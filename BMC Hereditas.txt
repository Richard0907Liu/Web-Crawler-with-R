"AbstractUnique divergence of the BRCA2, a tumor suppressor gene, in Neanderthals relative to other primates, including modern humans, is highlighted. This divergence with potentially pathogenic consequences raises a question about cancer susceptibility in the archaic species that was replaced by modern humans about 40,000 years ago.", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                This study aimed to validate the function of CKX gene on grain numbers in wheat.\n              \n                Methods\n                we constructed and transformed a RNA interference expression vector of TaCKX2.4 in bread wheat line NB1. Southern blotting analysis was used to select transgenic plants with single copy. The expression of TaCKX2.4 gene was estimated by Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Finally, the relation between expression of TaCKX2.4 gene and grain numbers was validated.\n              \n                Results\n                Totally, 20 positive independent events were obtained. Homozygous lines from 5 events with a single copy of transformed gene each were selected to evaluate the expression of TaCKX2.4 and grain numbers per spike in T3 generation. Compared with the control NB1, the average grain numbers per spike significantly increased by 12.6%, 8.3%, 6.5% and 5.8% in the T3 lines JW39-3A, JW1-2B, JW1-1A and JW5-1A, respectively.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Our study indicated that the expression level of TaCKX2.4 was negatively correlated with the grain number per spike, indicating that the reduced expression of TaCKX2.4 increased grain numbers per spike in wheat.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                For a proportion of individuals judged clinically to have a recessive Mendelian disease, only one heterozygous pathogenic variant can be found from clinical whole exome sequencing (WES), posing a challenge to genetic diagnosis and genetic counseling. One possible reason is the limited ability to detect disease causal structural variants (SVs) from short reads sequencing technologies. Long reads sequencing can produce longer reads (typically 1000 bp or longer), therefore offering greatly improved ability to detect SVs that may be missed by short-read sequencing.\n              \n                Results\n                Here we describe a case study, where WES identified only one heterozygous pathogenic variant for an individual suspected to have glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia), which is an autosomal recessive disease caused by bi-allelic mutations in the G6PC gene. Through Nanopore long-read whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 7.1 kb deletion covering two exons on the other allele, suggesting that complex structural variants (SVs) may explain a fraction of cases when the second pathogenic allele is missing from WES on recessive diseases. Both breakpoints of the deletion are within Alu elements, and we designed Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR assays based on the breakpoints for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for the family planning on another child. Four embryos were obtained after in vitro fertilization (IVF), and an embryo without deletion in G6PC was transplanted after PGD and was confirmed by prenatal diagnosis, postnatal diagnosis, and subsequent lack of disease symptoms after birth.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                In summary, we present one of the first examples of using long-read sequencing to identify causal yet complex SVs in exome-negative patients, which subsequently enabled successful personalized PGD.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                This complex environmental heterogeneity coupled with the long-standing history offers scenario suitable for and favoring the evolution and existence of variation of morphological traits.\n              \n                Methods\n                In this study, we measured 10 morphological traits of 310 Cynodon dactylon individuals sampled at 16 different locations along latitudinal gradients between 22°35'N and 36°18'N to reveal phenotypic plasticity influenced by latitude. In addition, the relationships between morphological variation and soil nutrient and climate factors were analyzed.\n              \n                Results\n                Analysis of variance, divesity examination and Mantel correlation test detected a significant effect of latitude on morphological traits. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis clearly separated the selected populations into four groups according to latitude. Larger morphological sizes of C. dactylon appeared at the low- and high-latitude regions. Correlation analysis indicated that high morphological variations were significantly correlated with climate factors and soil nutrient.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                This study suggests morphological variation of wild bermudagrass is greatly influenced by latitude as well as soil and climate, which could be useful resources for genetic studies and evolution.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                The striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, is the most common mammal in Korea. Although microsatellite loci for the species have been identified from populations in southwestern China, amplification of those markers for Korean populations have been unsuccessful. The complicated taxonomy of Korean striped field mouse including populations on Jeju Island (A. a chejuensis) necessitates identification of additional molecular markers.\n              \n                Findings\n                We applied 454 pyrosequencing systems to develop a suite of microsatellite markers. Muscle tissue was harvested and sequenced from 30 Jeju striped field mouse specimens which yielded 12,165 reads with a mean length per read of 287 bp. From these reads, we identified 17 microsatellite loci for A. a. chejuensis and tested these new markers against samples of both A. a chejuensis and A. a coreae, the mainland taxon. All 17 loci were amplified successfully for both taxa. Of the total 17 loci, one locus failed to amplify for a population on Heuksan Island. The cross-species transferability was also tested with the allied taxon, A. peninsulae and confirmed successful for 12 loci.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                These newly developed markers will benefit studies of genetic structure, evolution, and resolving taxonomic problems of striped field mice and allied taxa in Korea.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Brassica oleracea, B. rapa and B. napus encompass many economically important vegetable and oil crops; such as cabbage, broccoli, canola and Chinese cabbage. The genome sequencing of these species allows for gene discovery with an eye towards discerning the natural variability available for future breeding. The Q-type C2H2 zinc-finger protein (ZFP) transcription factors contain zinc finger motifs with a conserved QALGGH as part of the motif and they may play a critical role in the plants response to stress. While they may contain from one to five ZF domains (ZFD) this work focuses on the ZFPs that contain two zinc-fingers, which bind to the promoter of genes, and negatively regulate transcription via the EAR motif. B. oleracea and rapa are diploid and evolved into distinct species about 3.7 million years ago. B. napus is polyploid and formed by fusion of the diploids about 7500 years ago.\n              \n                Results\n                This work identifies a total of 146 Q-type C2H2-ZFPs with 37 in B. oleracea, 35 in B. rapa and 74 in B. napus. The level of sequence similarity and arrangement of these genes on their chromosomes have mostly remained intact in B. napus, when compared to the chromosomes inherited from either B. rapa or oleracea. In contrast, the difference between the protein sequences of the orthologs of B. rapa and oleracea is greater and their organization on the chromosomes is much more divergent. In general, the 146 proteins are highly conserved especially within the known motifs. Differences within subgroups of ZFPs were identified. Considering that B. napus has twice the number of these proteins in its genome, RNA-Seq data was mined and the expression of 68 of the 74 genes was confirmed.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Alignment of these proteins gives a snapshot of the variability that may be available naturally in Brassica species. The aim is to study how different ZFPs bind different genes or how dissimilar EAR motifs alter the negative regulation of the genes bound to the ZFP. Results from such studies could be used to enhance tolerance in future Brassica breeding programs.\n              ", 
"AbstractIn this commentary, I will review the latest findings on the Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen in Drosophila, a paradigm for gradient formation taught to biology students for more than two decades. “Seeing is believing” also summarizes the erroneous steps that were needed to elucidate the mechanisms of gradient formation and the path of movement of Bcd. Initially proclaimed as a dogma in 1988 and later incorporated into the SDD model where the broad diffusion of Bcd throughout the embryo was the predominant step leading to gradient formation, the SDD model was irrefutable for more than two decades until first doubts were raised in 2007 regarding the diffusion properties of Bcd associated with the SDD model. This led to re-thinking of the issue and the definition of a new model, termed the ARTS model which could explain most of the physical constraints that were inherently associated with the SDD model. In the ARTS model, gradient formation is mediated by the mRNA which is redistributed along cortical microtubules to form a mRNA gradient which is translated to form the protein gradient. Contrary to the SDD model, there is no Bcd diffusion from the tip. The ARTS model is also compatible with the observed cortical movement of Bcd. I will critically compare the SDD and the ARTS models as well as other models, analyze the major differences, and highlight the path where Bcd is localized during early nuclear cycles.", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                DNA damage generally results in the activation of ATM/ATR kinases and the downstream checkpoint kinases Chk1/Chk2. In Drosophila melanogaster, the ATR homologue meiotic 41 (mei-41) is pivotal to DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint signalling. Although various mei-41 mutant alleles have been analyzed in the past, no gain-of-function allele is yet available. To fill this gap, we have generated transgenic flies allowing temporal and tissue-specific induction of mei-41.\n              \n                Results\n                Overexpression of mei-41 in wing and eye anlagen affects proliferation and a G2/M checkpoint even in the absence of genomic stress. Similar consequences were observed following the overexpression of the downstream kinase Grapes (Grp) but not of Loki (Lok), encoding the respective Drosophila Chk1 and Chk2 homologues, in agreement with their previously reported activities. Moreover, we show that irradiation induced cell cycle arrest was prolonged in the presence of ectopic mei-41 expression. Similar to irradiation stress, mei-41 triggered the occurrence of a slower migrating form of Grp, implying specific phosphorylation of Grp in response to either signal. Using a p53R-GFP biosensor, we further show that overexpression of mei-41 was sufficient to elicit a robust p53 activation in vivo.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                We conclude that overexpression of the Drosophila ATR homologue mei-41 elicits an effectual DNA damage response irrespective of irradiation.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                The cis-acting element DRE/CRT plays an important role in activating gene expression responsive to osmotic stress, low temperature and high-salinity. DREB1/CBF genes encode DRE-binding proteins with the function as transcript activators. TaDREB1 was also found to be induced by osmotic stress.\n              \n                Methods\n                The dates of osmotic stress was assessed by seed germination drought resistance index; the full-length cDNA sequences of TaDREB1 gene were downloaded from NCBI datebase; identification of allelic variation and transcript expression were assessed by PCR and semi-quantitive RT-PCR analysis, respectively.\n              \n                Results\n                Total 13 new allele variations of TaDREB1 were identified in the germplasms tested in the paper, including 5 TaDREB1-A on chromosome 3AL, 4 TaDREB1-B on chromosome 3BL and 4 TaDREB1-D on chromosome 3DL. In each variety, there existed two loci of TaDREB1-D genes, named TaDREB1-D1 and TaDREB1-D2, both of which had the similar nucleotide sequence except an 11 bp insertion in the former. In wheat seeds under osmotic stress, we did not detect the transcript expression level of TaDREB1-A and TaDREB1-B, but that of TaDREB1-D.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The capacity of osmotic stress tolerance was closely correlated with the expression level and tendency of TaDREB1-D.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Red-skinned pears are attractive to consumers because of their aesthetic appeal and the antioxidant-associated health benefits provided by the anthocyanins in their red skin. In China, the ‘Red Zaosu’ (RZS) red bud mutation of the Zaosu (ZS) pear has been used as a parent in Asian pear breeding to generate new cultivars with crispy red fruit and red tender shoots resembling those of the ‘Max Red Bartlett’ (MRB) pears.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, a segregation ratio of 1:1 was observed between plants with red or green shoots in four families with RZS as the only red shoot gene donor parent, suggesting that the red shoot trait of RZS is associated with a dominant gene. Three markers, In1400–1, In1579–1 and In1579–3, were chosen from 22 pairs of indel primers targeting regions in the vicinity of the previously identified red fruit skin locus of MRB and were able to effectively distinguish the eight red shoot plants from the eight green shoot plants. Linkage analysis indicated that the genetic distance between the two marker loci (In1579–1 and In1579–3) and the red shoot locus of RZS were both 1.4 cM, while the genetic distance between the In1400–1 marker and the red shoot locus was 2.1 cM. The physical position of the red locus in RZS should be in the 368.6 kb candidate interval at the bottom of LG4.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The genetic locus responsible for the red tender shoots of RZS was located in the same interval of the red fruit skin gene of MRB, meaning that the bud mutation loci of RZS and MRB may be the same or adjacent to each other, and the red shoot trait and the red fruit skin trait in RZS may be controlled by the same, or a closely linked locus. As a result, breeders could use red shoots as a morphological marker to select for the red-skinned hybrids from RZS families.\n              ", 
"AbstractCapillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) is a clinical entity newly identified in 2003 that is caused by mutation of the RASA-1 gene, which encodes the protein p120-RasGAP. To date, most of the clinical reports on CM-AVM in the literature involve samples entirely consisting of Caucasians of European and North American descent, while reports from China or East Asia are few. Here, we describe a genetic clinical report of CM-AVM. Sequencing revealed a novel stop mutation in the RASA-1 gene causing loss of function (LOF) of the RasGAP domain. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic clinical report of a CM-AVM patient in East Asia. This report may extend our understanding and support further studies of CM-AVM in East Asia.", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Clematis is the biggest genus in the family Ranunculaceae with about 300 species. Clematis is also a globally important commercial group of flowers, especially in the United States and European countries. Their petals with different colors and shapes make the genus the “Queen of the Vines”. However, the genomic information and phylogeny of Clematis based on existing molecular studies are limited. In this paper, new microsatellites (SSR) markers were identified from the transcriptome data of C. finetiana obtained using the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology.\n              \n                Results\n                Sequences on a total of 71,900 high-quality unigenes with the mean length of 865 bp were produced in this study. There were 6192unigenes annotated and classified into 49 functional sub-groups in three main ontology categories in GO (Gen Ontology) database,14,022 unigenes mapped to COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database and classified into 25 functional categories, and 21,494 unigenes obtained and divided into 128 pathways of KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes) Database. A total of 7532 SSRs were discovered from 6337 unigenes. We randomly tested 210 primer pairs, of which 52 primer pairs were able to generate specific products, and 19 possessed polymorphism in the 13 wild populations of six species from Clematis, which were used as a test material.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The dataset of C. finetiana transcriptome and the identified new SSR markers will promote genetic research and breeding effort in Clematis.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Qinba area has a long history of tea planting and is a northernmost region in China where Camellia sinensis L. is grown. In order to provide basic data for selection and optimization of molecular markers of tea plants. 118 markers, including 40 EST-SSR, 40 SRAP and 38 SCoT markers were used to evaluate the genetic diversity of 50 tea plant (Camellia sinensis.) samples collected from Qinb. tea germplasm, assess population structure.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, a total of 414 alleles were obtained using 38 pairs of SCoT primers, with an average of 10.89 alleles per primer. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB), polymorphism information content (PIC), resolving power (Rp), effective multiplex ratio (EMR), average band informativeness (Ibav), and marker index (MI) were 96.14%, 0.79, 6.71, 10.47, 0.58, and 6.07 respectively. 338 alleles were amplified via 40 pairs of SRAP (8.45 per primer), with PPB, PIC, Rp, EMR, Ibav, and MI values of 89.35%, 0.77, 5.11, 7.55, 0.61, and 4.61, respectively. Furthermore, 320 alleles have been detected using 40 EST-SSR primers (8.00 per primer), with PPB, PIC, Rp, EMR, Ibav, and MI values of 94.06%, 0.85, 4.48, 7.53, 0.56, and 4.22 respectively. These results indicated that SCoT markers had higher efficiency.\n                Mantel test was used to analyze the genetic distance matrix generated by EST-SSRs, SRAPs and SCoTs. The results showed that the correlation between the genetic distance matrix based on EST-SSR and that based on SRAP was very small (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01), followed by SCoT and SRAP (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.17), then by SCoT and EST-SSR (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.19).\n                The 50 tea samples were divided into two sub-populations using STRUCTURE, Neighbor-joining (NJ) method and principal component analyses (PCA). The results produced by STRUCTURE were completely consistent with the PCA analysis. Furthermore, there is no obvious relationship between the results produced using sub-populational and geographical data.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Among the three types of markers, SCoT markers has many advantages in terms of NPB, PPB, Rp, EMR, and MI. Nevertheless, the values of PIC showed different trends, with the highest values generated with EST-SSR, followed by SCoT and SRAP. The average band informativeness showed similar trends. Correlation between genetic distances produced by three different molecular markers were very small, thus it is not recommended to use a single marker to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure. It is hence suggested that combining of different types of molecular markers should be used to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure. It also seems crucial to screen out, for each type of molecular markers, core markers of Camellia sinensis. This study revealed that genes of exotic plant varieties have been constantly integrated into the gene pool of Qinba area tea. A low level of genetic diversity was observed; this is shown by an average coefficient of genetic similarity of 0.74.\n              ",

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMIs) were obtained by R Bioconductor packages. Functional and enrichment analyses of selected genes were performed using DAVID database. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. The relationships among the DEGs and module in PPI network were analyzed by plug-in NetworkAnalyzer and MCODE seperately. Through the TargetScan and comparing target genes with DEGs, the miRNA-mRNA regulation network was established.\n              \n                Results\n                Totally 346 DEGs and 90 DEMIs were found to be differentially expressed. These DEGs were enriched in biological processes and KEGG pathway of inflammatory immune response. 25 genes in the PPI network were selected as hub genes. Top 10 hub genes were TYROBP, HLA-DRA, VWF, PPBP, SERPING1, HLA-DPA1, SERPINA1, KIF20A, FERMT3, HLA-E. PPI network of DEGs followed a pattern of power law network and met the characteristics of small-world network. MCODE analysis identified 4 clusters and the most significant cluster consisted of 11 nodes and 55 edges. SEPP1, CKS2, TCAP, BPI were identified as the seed genes in their own clusters, respectively. The miRNA-mRNA regulation network which was composed of 89 pairs was established. MiR-210 had the highest connectivity with 12 target genes. Among the predicted target of MiR-96, HLA-DPA1 and TYROBP were the hub genes.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Our study indicated possible differentially expressed genes and miRNA, and microRNA-mRNA negative regulatory networks in osteosarcoma by bioinformatics analysis, which may provide novel insights for unraveling pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.\n              ",

Therefore, for such soils, growing Al tolerant cultivars is imperative for high productivity.\n              \n                Methods\n                In this study, molecular markers associated with Al tolerance were identified using a mapping population developed by crossing two contrasting genotypes for this trait.\n              \n                Results\n                Four SSR (Xtxp34, Sb5_236, Sb6_34, and Sb6_342), one STS (CTG29_3b) and three ISSR (811_1400, 835_200 and 884_200) markers produced alleles that showed significant association with Al tolerance. CTG29_3b, 811_1400, Xtxp34 and Sb5_236 are located on chromosome 3 with the first two markers located close to AltSB\n                  , a locus that underlie the Al tolerance gene (SbMATE) implying that their association with Al tolerance is due to their linkage to this gene. Although CTG29_3b and 811_1400 are located closer to AltSB\n                  , Xtxp34 and Sb5_236 explained higher phenotypic variance of Al tolerance indices. Markers 835_200, 884_200, Sb6_34 and Sb6_342 are located on different chromosomes, which implies the presence of several genes involved in Al tolerance in addition to SbMATE in sorghum.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                These molecular markers have a high potential for use in breeding for Al tolerance in sorghum.\n              ",

Our analyses revealed that Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations have distinct genetic makeup and can be well distinguished based on either the genome wide data or a panel of ancestry informative markers (AIMs). Their genetic structure corresponds well to their geographical distributions, indicating geographical isolation played a critical role in driving population differentiation in East Asia. The most recent common ancestor of the three populations was dated back to 3000 ~<U+2009>3600 years ago.

"AbstractTo search the evidence of molecular evolution mechanism for aquatic and cave habitat in Andrias davidianus, the evolution analysis was carried out among several species transcriptome data. The transcriptome data of Notophthalmus viridescens, Xenopus tropicalis, Cynops pyrrhogaster, Hynobius chinensis and A. davidianus were obtained from the Genbank and reassembled except Xenopus tropicalis. The BLAST search of transcriptome data obtained 1244 single-copy orthologous genes among five species. A phylogenetic tree showed A. davidianus to have the closest relationship to H. chinensis. Fourteen positively selected genes were detected in A. davidianus and N. vridescens group and fifteen in A. davidianus and H. chinensis group. Five genes were shared in the both groups which involved in the immune system, suggesting that A. davidianus adaptation to an aquatic and cave environment required rapid evolution of the immune system compared to N. viridescens and H. chinensis.", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Tamoxifen is the first-line hormone therapy for estrogen receptor alpha positive (ERa+) breast cancer. However, about 40% of patients with ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer who receive tamoxifen therapy eventually develop resistance resulting in a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to mine available data sets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (tissue samples), and to identify all miRNAs associated with tamoxifen resistance (TamR) in breast cancer. Secondly, this study aimed to predict the key gene regulatory networks of newly found TamR-related miRNAs and evaluate the potential role of the miRNAs and targets as potential prognosis biomarkers for breast cancer patients.\n              \n                Result\n                Microarray data sets from two different studies were used from the GEO database: 1. GSE66607: miRNA of MCF-7 TamR cells; 2. GSE37405: TamR tissues. Differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified in both data sets and 5 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to overlap between the two data sets. Profiles of GSE37405 and data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter Database (KMPD) along with Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were used to reveal the relationship between these 5 miRNAs and overall survival. The results showed that has-miR-542-5p was the only miRNA associated with overall survival of ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen. Targets of has-miR-542-5p were predicted by miRanda and TargetScan, and the mRNA expression of the three 3 target gene, Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/Tryptophan 5-Monooxygenase Activation Protein Beta (YWHAB), Lymphocyte Antigen 9 (LY9), and Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) were associated with overall survival in 2 different databases. Copy-number alterations (CNAs) of SFRP1 confer survival disadvantage to breast cancer patients and alter the mRNA expression of SFRP1 in cBioPortal database.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                This study indicates that miRNA has-miR-542-5p is associated with TamR and can predict prognosis of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, has-miR-542-5p may be acting through a mechanism involving the target genes YWHAB, LY9, and SFRP1.

Of note, the risk allele (A allele) of SNP rs4522708 is same in European and Chinese populations. Meta-analysis of Chinese and European samples further strengthened the association of rs4522708 with SCZ (ORA allele<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.074, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.26<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-11).

"Abstract\n                Background\n                Genealogy and molecular genetic studies of a Swedish river valley population resulted in a large pedigree, showing that the hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) HFE/p.C282Y mutation is inherited with other recessive disorders such as Wilson´s disease (WND), a rare recessive disorder of copper overload. The population also contain individuals with the Swedish long QT syndrome (LQTS1) founder mutation (KCNQ1/p.Y111C) which in homozygotes causes the Jervell & Lange Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) and hearing loss (HL).\n                Aims of the study were to test whether the Swedish long QT founder mutation originated in an ancestral HFE family and if carriers had an increased risk for hemochromatosis (HH), a treatable disorder.

Eleven LQTS probands confirmed origin in a second founder couple (b 1614/1605) in which the woman b 1605 was identical to a HFE pedigree member from the Fjällsjö river. In her descent there were not only 64 HH, six WND families, one JLNS, but also 48 hearing loss families. Most hearing loss was non syndromic and caused by founder effects of the late 16th century. One was of Swedish origin carrying the WHRN, c.1977delC, (p.S660Afs*30) mutation, the other was a TMC1(NM_138691),c.1814T>C,(p.L605P) mutation, possibly of Finnish origin.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Deep human HFE genealogies show HFE to be associated with other genetic disorders like Wilson´s disease, LQTS, JLNS, and autosomal recessive hearing loss. Two new homozygous HL mutations in WHRN/p.S660Afs*30 and TMC1/p.L605P were identified,none of them previously reported from Scandinavia. The rarity of JLNS was possibly caused by miscarriage or intrauterine death. Most hearing loss (81.7%) was seen after 1844 when first cousin marriages were permitted. However, only 10 (10.3%) came from 1st cousin unions and only 2 (2.0 %) was born out of wedlock.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                \n                           Elymus sibiricus is an important native grass in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Seed shattering is a serious problem for E. sibiricus, especially at harvest time. Cross breeding is an effective way to create new varieties with beneficial characteristic or improved traits, and to broaden genetic base.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, we created five hybrid populations by crossing seven E. sibiricus genotypes that have seed shattering variation. Then, nine EST-SSR primers were used for hybrid identification based on DNA fingerprinting, and genetic diversity analysis of hybrid populations and their respective parents. A total of 15 hybrids were identified. An analysis of amplified polymorphic bands among genuine hybrids and their respective parents revealed mainly two types of markers: 1) hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in both parents; 2)hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in male parents. For each hybrid population, the total number of amplified bands ranged from 37 to 57, the percentage of polymorphism varied from 65.12% to 75.68%, with an average of 70.51%. Novel bands found in each hybrid population varied from 0 to 9 bands, suggesting an occurrence of rearrangements in the hybrid population. The structure analysis revealed that all hybrid populations and parents were assigned to eight groups. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed similar results.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                In general, this study proved EST-SSR markers are efficient for hybrid identification, and suggested more genetic variation could be captured in hybrid populations by crossing breeding.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                The C-repeat-binding factors/DRE-binding factors (CBF/DREBs) comprise a key transcription factor family involved in plant stress tolerance. Yet, there is limited information about switchgrass DREB genes and their functional roles.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, four cold-inducible PvDREB1s were identified from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), among which PvDREB1C was the one responded to cold stress later than the other three PvDREB1s. Yet, ectopic overexpression of PvDREB1C led to significantly compromised, instead of improved cold tolerance in transgenic tobacco. On the other hand, PvDREB1C was transcriptionally down-regulated in response to salt stress, but overexpression of PvDREB1C improved plant salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco. The improved salt tolerance was associated with increased K+/Na+ ratio and Ca2+ content, higher cellular osmotic potential, and activation of stress-related functional genes in the leaves of transgenic plants under salt stress.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The current results implied that PvDREB1C played opposite roles in plant cold and salt tolerance. Although DREB1s were known as positive stress regulators, particular attentions shall be paid to their potential negative regulatory role(s).\n              ",

However, a paucity of genomic information and DNA markers has restricted the development of modern breeding technologies for almond trees.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, almonds were sequenced with Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to obtain transcriptome data and develop simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. We generated approximately 64 million clean reads from the various tissues of mixed almonds, and a total of 42,135 unigenes with an average length of 988 bp were obtained in the present study. A total of 27,586 unigenes (57.7% of all unigenes generated) were annotated using several databases. A total of 112,812 unigenes were annotated with the Gene Ontology (GO) database and assigned to 82 functional sub-groups, and 29,075 unigenes were assigned to the KOG database and classified into 25 function classifications. There were 9470 unigenes assigned to 129 Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways from five categories in the KEGG pathway database. We further identified 8641 SSR markers from 48,012 unigenes. A total of 100 SSR markers were randomly selected to validate quality, and 82 markers could amplify the specific products of A. communis L., whereas 70 markers were successfully transferable to five species (A. ledebouriana, A. mongolica, A. pedunculata, A. tangutica, and A. triloba).\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our study was the first to produce public transcriptome data from almonds.

"Abstract\n                Background\n                Studies on the molecular genetics of horse skin pigmentation have typically focused on very few genes and proteins. In this study, we used Illumina sequencing to determine the global gene expression profiles in horses with white-colored coats and those with black-colored coats, with the goal of identifying novel genes that could regulate horse coat color.\n              \n                Results\n                Genes encoding ribosomal-associated proteins were highly expressed in horse skin. We found a total of 231 unigenes that were differentially expressed between horses with white coats and horses with black coats; 119 were down-regulated, and 112 were up-regulated. Many of the up-regulated genes in black horses, such as genes related to tyrosine metabolism, may directly regulate dark coat color. Keratin genes, MIA family genes, fatty acid-related genes, and melanoma-associated genes were also differentially regulated, which suggests that they may play important roles in coat color formation.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                These findings show that the transcription profiles from white and black horse skin provide useful information to understand the genetics underlying the control of skin melanin synthesis in horses, which may enhance our knowledge of human skin diseases, such as melanoma and albinism.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                micro RNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of many biological pathways. A plethora of steps are required to form, from a precursor, the mature miRNA that eventually acts on its target RNA to repress its expression or to inhibit translation. Recently, Drosophila nibbler (nbr) has been shown to be an important player in the maturation process of miRNA and piRNA. Nbr is an exoribonuclease which helps to shape the 3' end of miRNAs by trimming the 3' overhang to a final length.\n              \n                Results\n                In contrast to previous reports on the localization of Nbr, we report that 1) Nbr is expressed only during a short time of oogenesis and appears ubiquitously localized within oocytes, and that 2) Nbr was is not enriched in the nuage where it was shown to be involved in piwi-mediated mechanisms. To date, there is little information available on the function of nbr for cellular and developmental processes. Due to the fact that nbr mutants are viable with minor deleterious effects, we used the GAL4/UAS over-expression system to define novel functions of nbr. We disclose hitherto unknown functions of nbr 1) as a tumor suppressor and 2) as a suppressor of RNAi. Finally, we confirm that nbr is a suppressor of transposon activity.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our data suggest that nbr exerts much more widespread functions than previously reported from trimming 3' ends of miRNAs only.\n              ",

In fruits, sugar metabolism and accumulation are important factors for fruit organoleptic quality. Post-harvest ripening is a special feature of ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, transcriptome sequencing based on the Illumina platform generated 23.8 - 35.8 million unigenes of nine cDNA libraries constructed using RNAs from the ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ pear variety with different treatments, in which 2629 new genes were discovered, and 2121 of them were annotated. A total of 2146 DEGs, 3650 DEGs, 1830 DEGs from each comparison were assembled. Moreover, the gene expression patterns of 8 unigenes related to sugar metabolism revealed by qPCR. The main constituents of soluble sugars were fructose and glucose after pear fruit post-harvest ripening, and five unigenes involved in sugar metabolism were discovered.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our study not only provides a large-scale assessment of transcriptome resources of ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ but also lays the foundation for further research into genes correlated with sugar metabolism.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Short-culm mutants have been widely used in breeding programs to increase lodging resistance. In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), several hundreds of short-culm mutants have been isolated over the years. The objective of the present study was to identify the Brachytic1 (Brh1) semi-dwarfing gene and to test its effect on yield and malting quality.\n              \n                Results\n                Double-haploid lines generated through a cross between a brh1.a mutant and the European elite malting cultivar Quench, showed good malting quality but a decrease in yield. Especially the activities of the starch degrading enzymes ß-amylase and free limit dextrinase were high. A syntenic approach comparing markers in barley to those in rice (Oryza sativa L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench) and brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon P. Beauv) helped us to identify Brh1 as an orthologue of rice D1 encoding the Ga subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein. We demonstrated that Brh1 is allelic to Ari-m. Sixteen different mutant alleles were described at the DNA level.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Mutants in the Brh1 locus are deficient in the Ga subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein, which shows that heterotrimeric G proteins are important regulators of culm length in barley. Mutant alleles do not have any major negative effects on malting quality.\n              ", 
"AbstractThe diagnosis of schizophrenia is currently based on the symptoms and bodily signs rather than on the pathological and physiological markers of the patient. In the search for new molecular targeted therapy medicines, and recurrence of early-warning indicators have become the major focus of contemporary research, because they improve diagnostic accuracy. Biomarkers reflect the physiological, physical and biochemical status of the body, and so have extensive applicability and practical significance. The ascertainment of schizophrenia biomarkers will help diagnose, stratify of disease, and treat of schizophrenia patients. The detection of biomarkers from blood has become a promising area of schizophrenia research. Recently, a series of studies revealed that, MiRNAs play an important role in the genesis of schizophrenia, and their abnormal expressions have the potential to be used as biomarkers of schizophrenia. This article presents and summarizes the value of peripheral blood miRNAs with abnormal expression as the biomarker of schizophrenia.", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Interspecific hybrid bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy] is one of the most widely used grasses on golf courses, with cultivars derived from ‘Tifgreen’ or ‘Tifdwarf’ particularly used for putting greens. Many bermudagrass cultivars established for putting greens can be genetically unstable and lead to the occurrence of undesirable off-type grasses that vary in phenotype. The objective of this research was to genetically and phenotypically differentiate off-type grasses and hybrid cultivars. Beginning in 2013, off-type and desirable hybrid bermudagrass samples were collected from golf course putting greens in the southeastern United States and genetically and phenotypically characterized using genotyping-by-sequencing and morphology.\n              \n                Results\n                Genotyping-by-sequencing determined that 11% (5) of off-type and desirable samples from putting greens were genetically divergent from standard cultivars such as Champion, MiniVerde, Tifdwarf, TifEagle, and Tifgreen. In addition, genotyping-by-sequencing was unable to genetically distinguish all standard cultivars from one another due to their similar origin and clonal propagation; however, over 90,000 potentially informative nucleotide variants were identified among the triploid hybrid cultivars.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Although few genetic differences were found in this research, samples harvested from golf course putting greens had variable morphology and were clustered into three distinct phenotypic groups. The majority of off-type grasses in hybrid bermudagrass putting greens were genetically similar with variable morphological traits. Off-type grasses within golf course putting greens have the potential to compromise putting surface functionality and aesthetics.\n              ", 
"AbstractThe development of human genetics world-wide during the twentieth century, especially across Europe, has occurred against a background of repeated catastrophes, including two world wars and the ideological problems and repression posed by Nazism and Communism. The published scientific literature gives few hints of these problems and there is a danger that they will be forgotten.The First World War was largely indiscriminate in its carnage, but World War 2 and the preceding years of fascism were associated with widespread migration, especially of Jewish workers expelled from Germany, and of their children, a number of whom would become major contributors to the post-war generation of human and medical geneticists in Britain and America. In Germany itself, eminent geneticists were also involved in the abuses carried out in the name of ‘eugenics’ and ‘race biology’. However, geneticists in America, Britain and the rest of Europe were largely responsible for the ideological foundations of these abuses.In the Soviet Union, geneticists and genetics itself became the object of persecution from the 1930s till as late as the mid 1960s, with an almost complete destruction of the field during this time; this extended also to Eastern Europe and China as part of the influence of Russian communism. Most recently, at the end of the twentieth century, China saw a renewal of government sponsored eugenics programmes, now mostly discarded.During the post-world war 2 decades, human genetics research benefited greatly from recognition of the genetic dangers posed by exposure to radiation, following the atomic bomb explosions in Japan, atmospheric testing and successive accidental nuclear disasters in Russia.Documenting and remembering these traumatic events, now largely forgotten among younger workers, is essential if we are to fully understand the history of human genetics and avoid the repetition of similar disasters in the future. The power of modern human genetic and genomic techniques now gives a greater potential for abuse as well as for beneficial use than has ever been seen in the past.", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Oilseed Brassica represents an important group of oilseed crops with a long history of evolution and cultivation. To understand the origin and evolution of Brassica amphidiploids, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to unravel genetic variations in three diploids and three amphidiploid Brassica species of U’s triangle along with Eruca sativa as an outlier.\n              \n                Results\n                Of 124 Brassica-derived SSR loci assayed, 100% cross-transferability was obtained for B. juncea and three subspecies of B. rapa, while lowest cross-transferability (91.93%) was obtained for Eruca sativa. The average % age of cross-transferability across all the seven species was 98.15%. The number of alleles detected at each locus ranged from one to six with an average of 3.41 alleles per primer pair. Neighbor-Joining-based dendrogram divided all the 40 accessions into two main groups composed of B. juncea/B. nigra/B. rapa and B. carinata/B. napus/B. oleracea. C-genome of oilseed Brassica species remained relatively more conserved than A- and B-genome. A- genome present in B. juncea and B. napus seems distinct from each other and hence provides great opportunity for generating diversity through synthesizing amphidiploids from different sources of A- genome. B. juncea had least intra-specific distance indicating narrow genetic base. B. rapa appears to be more primitive species from which other two diploid species might have evolved.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                The SSR marker set developed in this study will assist in DNA fingerprinting of various Brassica species cultivars, evaluating the genetic diversity in Brassica germplasm, genome mapping and construction of linkage maps, gene tagging and various other genomics-related studies in Brassica species. Further, the evolutionary relationship established among various Brassica species would assist in formulating suitable breeding strategies for widening the genetic base of Brassica amphidiploids by exploiting the genetic diversity present in diploid progenitor gene pools.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common mental disorder with high heritability, and genetic factors play a major role in the pathogenesis.

"Abstract\n                Background\n                A core collection is a subset of an entire collection that represents as much of the genetic diversity of the entire collection as possible. The establishment of a core collection for crops is practical for efficient management and use of germplasm. However, the establishment of a core collection of mushrooms is still in its infancy, and no established core collection of the economically important species Flammulina velutipes has been reported.\n              \n                Results\n                We established the first core collection of F. velutipes, containing 32 strains based on 81 genetically different F. veltuipes strains. The allele retention proportion of the core collection for the entire collection was 100%. Moreover, the genetic diversity parameters (the effective number of alleles, Nei’s expected heterozygosity, the number of observed heterozygosity, and Shannon’s information index) of the core collection showed no significant differences from the entire collection (p > 0.01). Thus, the core collection is representative of the genetic diversity of the entire collection. Genetic structure analyses of the core collection revealed that the 32 strains could be clustered into 6 groups, among which groups 1 to 3 were cultivars and groups 4 to 6 were wild strains. The wild strains from different locations harbor their own specific alleles, and were clustered stringently in accordance with their geographic origins. Genetic diversity analyses of the core collection revealed that the wild strains possessed greater genetic diversity than the cultivars.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                We established the first core collection of F. velutipes in China, which is an important platform for efficient breeding of this mushroom in the future. In addition, the wild strains in the core collection possess favorable agronomic characters and produce unique bioactive compounds, adding value to the platform.

"AbstractWheat is globally one of the most important crops. With the current human population growth rate, there is an increasing need to raise wheat productivity by means of plant breeding, along with development of more efficient and sustainable agricultural systems. Damage by pathogens and pests, in combination with adverse climate effects, need to be counteracted by incorporating new germplasm that makes wheat more resistant/tolerant to such stress factors. Rye has been used as a source for improved resistance to pathogens and pests in wheat during more than 50 years. With new devastating stem and yellow rust pathotypes invading wheat at large acreage globally, along with new biotypes of pest insects, there is renewed interest in using rye as a source of resistance.Currently the proportion of wheat cultivars with rye chromatin varies between countries, with examples of up to 34%. There is mainly one rye source, Petkus, that has been widely exploited and that has contributed considerably to raise yields and increase disease resistance in wheat. Successively, the multiple disease resistances conferred by this source has been overcome by new pathotypes of leaf rust, yellow rust, stem rust and powdery mildew. However, there are several other rye sources reported to make wheat more resistant to various biotic constraints when their rye chromatin has been transferred to wheat.

"Abstract\n                Background\n                Ongoing molecular processes in a cell could target microsatellites, a kind of repetitive DNA, owing to length variations and motif imperfection. Mutational mechanisms underlying such kind of genetic variations have been extensively investigated in diverse organisms. However, obscure impact of ploidization, an evolutionary process of genome content duplication prevails mostly in plants, on non-coding DNA is poorly understood.\n              \n                Results\n                Genome sequences of diversely originated plant species were examined for genome-wide motif imperfection pattern, and various analytical tools were employed to canvass characteristic relationships among repeat density, imperfection and length of microsatellites. Moreover, comparative genomics approach aided in exploration of microsatellites conservation footprints in Gossypium evolution. Based on our results, motif imperfection in repeat length was found intricately related to genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites among 13 genomes. Microsatellite decay estimation depicted slower decay of long motif repeats which led to predominant abundance of 5-nt repeat motif in Gossypium species. Short motif repeats exhibited rapid decay through the evolution of Gossypium lineage ensuing drastic decrease of 2-nt repeats, of which, “AT” motif type dilapidated in cultivated tetraploids of cotton.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                The outcome could be a directive to explore comparative evolutionary footprints of simple non-coding genetic elements i.e., repeat elements, through the evolution of genus-specific characteristics in cotton genomes.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI, EC 5.3.1.9) is an essential metabolic enzyme in all eukaryotes. An earlier study of the PgiC1 gene, which encodes cytosolic PGI in the grass Festuca ovina L., revealed a marked difference in the levels of nucleotide polymorphism between the 5’ and 3’ portions of the gene.\n              \n                Methods\n                In the present study, we characterized the sequence polymorphism in F. ovina PgiC1 in more detail and examined possible explanations for the non-uniform pattern of nucleotide polymorphism across the gene.\n              \n                Results\n                Our study confirms that the two portions of the PgiC1 gene show substantially different levels of DNA polymorphism and also suggests that the peptide encoded by the 3’ portion of PgiC1 is functionally and structurally more important than that encoded by the 5’ portion. Although there was some evidence of purifying selection (d\n                           N/d\n                           S test) on the 5’ portion of the gene, the signature of purifying selection was considerably stronger on the 3’ portion of the gene (d\n                           N/d\n                           S and McDonald–Kreitman tests). Several tests support the action of balancing selection within the 5’ portion of the gene. Wall’s B and Q tests were significant only for the 5’ portion of the gene. There were also marked peaks of nucleotide diversity, Tajima’s D and the d\n                           N/d\n                           S ratio at or around a PgiC1 codon site (within the 5’ portion of the gene) that a previous study had suggested was subject to positive diversifying selection.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our results suggest that the two portions of the gene have been subject to different selective regimes. Purifying selection appears to have been the main force contributing to the relatively low level of polymorphism within the 3’ portion of the sequence. In contrast, it is possible that balancing selection has contributed to the maintenance of the polymorphism within the 5’ portion of the gene.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Chromosome microdissection is one of the most important techniques in molecular cytogenetic research. Cotton (Gossypium Linnaeus, 1753) is the main natural fiber crop in the world. The resistance gene analog (RGA) cloning after its single chromosome microdissection can greatly promote cotton genome research and breeding.\n              \n                Results\n                Using the linker adaptor PCR (LA-PCR) with the primers of rice disease-resistance homologues, three nucleotide sequences PS016 (KU051681), PS054 (KU051682), and PS157 (KU051680) were obtained from the chromosome Ah01 of upland cotton (cv. TM-1). The Blast results showed that the three sequences are the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type RGAs. Clustering results indicated that they are homologous to these published RGAs. Thus, the three RGAs can definitely be confirmed as NBS-LRR class of RGAs in upland cotton.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Using single chromosome microdissection technique, DNA libraries containing cotton RGAs were obtained. This technique can promote cotton gene cloning, marker development and even the improvement of cotton genome research and breeding.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                \n                           Prunus triloba Lindl. is a naturally salt-alkaline-tolerant plant with several unique characteristics, and it can be used as the rootstock of Chinese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) in saline-alkaline soils. To comprehensively investigate the alkaline acclimation mechanisms in P. triloba, a series of analyses were conducted under alkaline stress, including analyses of the kinetics of molecular and physiological changes, and leaf microstructure.\n              \n                Results\n                To understand the kinetics of molecular changes under short-term alkaline stress, we used Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to identify alkaline stress-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in P. triloba. Approximately 53.0 million high-quality clean reads were generated from 59.6 million raw reads, and a total of 124,786 unigenes were obtained after de novo assembly of P. triloba transcriptome data. After alkaline stress treatment, a total of 8948 unigenes were identified as DEGs. Based on these DEGs, a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted, suggesting that 28 genes may play an important role in the early alkaline stress response. In addition, analysis of DEGs with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed that pathways were significant at different treatment time points. A significant positive correlation was found between the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results and the RNA-Seq data for seven alkaline-related genes, confirming the reliability of the RNA-Seq results. Based on physiological analysis of P. triloba in response to long-term alkaline stress, we found that the internal microstructures of the leaves of P. triloba changed to adapt to long-term alkaline stress. Various physiological indexes indicated that the degree of membrane injury increased with increasing duration of alkaline stress, affecting photosynthesis in P. triloba seedlings.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                This represents the first investigation into the physiology and transcriptome of P. triloba in response to alkaline stress. The results of this study can enrich the genomic resources available for P. triloba, as well as deepening our understanding of molecular and physiological alkaline tolerance mechanisms in P. triloba. This will also provide new insights into our understanding of alkaline acclimation mechanisms in Chinese plum (Prunus salicina) trees.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Until recently, mechanisms of segmentation established for Drosophila served as a paradigm for arthropod segmentation. However, with the discovery of gene expression waves in vertebrate segmentation, another paradigm based on oscillations linked to axial growth was established. The Notch pathway and hairy delay oscillator are basic components of this mechanism, as is the wnt pathway. With the establishment of oscillations during segmentation of the beetle Tribolium, a common segmentation mechanism may have been present in the last common ancestor of vertebrates and arthropods. However, the Notch pathway is not involved in segmentation of the initial Drosophila embryo. In arthropods, the engrailed, wingless pair has a much more conserved function in segmentation than most of the hierarchy established for Drosophila.\n                        \n              \n                Results\n                Here, we work backwards from this conserved pair by discussing possible mechanisms which could have taken over the role of the Notch pathway. We propose a pivotal role for the large transmembrane protein Ten-m/Odz. Ten-m/Odz may have had an ancient role in cell-cell communication, parallel to the Notch and wnt pathways. The Ten-m protein binds to the membrane with properties which resemble other membrane-based biochemical oscillators.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                We propose that such a simple transition could have formed the initial scaffold, on top of which the hierarchy, observed in the syncytium of dipterans, could have evolved.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Kala bhat (Black soybean) is an important legume crop in Uttarakhand state, India, due to its nutritional and medicinal properties. In the current study, the genetic variabilities present in Kala bhat were estimated using SSR markers and its variability was compared with other improved soybean varieties cultivated in Uttarakhand state, India.\n              \n                Results\n                Seventy-five genotypes cultivated in different districts of Uttarakhand were collected, and molecular analysis was done using 21 SSR markers. A total of 60 alleles were amplified with an average of 2.85 alleles per locus. The mean value of gene diversity and PIC was estimated to be 0.43 and 0.36, respectively. The unrooted phylogenetic tree grouped soybean genotypes into three major clusters, where, yellow seed coat (improved varieties) genotypes were grouped in one cluster, while reddish brown (improved varieties) and Kala bhat showed intermixing. Population structure divided the soybean genotypes into six different populations. AMOVA analysis showed 12% variance among the population, 66% variance among individual and 22% variance was observed within individuals. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) also showed that yellow seed coat genotypes were grouped in one cluster, whereas, the Kala bhat showed scattered distribution and few genotypes of Kala bhat showed grouping with red and yellow genotypes.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The different genetic diversity parameters used in the present study indicate that Kala bhat genotypes were more diverse than the yellow seed coat and brown seed coat colour genotypes. Therefore, Kala bhat genotypes can be a good source for the soybean breeding programme due to its better genetic diversity as well as its medicinal properties.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                With the increasing capacity of present-day next-generation sequencers the field of mitogenomics is rapidly changing. Enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction, is no longer necessary for obtaining mitogenomic data. Despite the benefits, shotgun sequencing approaches also have disadvantages. They do not guarantee obtaining the complete mitogenome, generally require larger amounts of input DNA and coverage is low compared to sequencing with enrichment strategies. If the mitogenome could be amplified in a single amplification, additional time and costs for sample preparation might outweigh these disadvantages.\n              \n                Results\n                A sequence of the complete mitochondrial genome of the pupilloid landsnail Orcula dolium is presented. The mitogenome was amplified in a single long-range (LR) PCR and sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies). The length is 14,063 nt and the average depth of coverage is 1112 X. This is the first published mitogenome for a member of the family Orculidae. It has the typical metazoan makeup of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNAs (12S and 16S) and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Orcula is positioned between Pupilla and the Vertiginidae as the sister-group of Gastrocopta and Vertigo, together. An ancestral gene order reconstruction shows that Orthurethra in contrast to other Stylommatophora, have tRNA-H before tRNA-G and that the gene order in the ‘non-achatinoid’ clade is identical to that of closely related non-stylommatophoran taxa.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                We show it is feasible to ultra-deep sequence a mitogenome from a single LR-PCR. This approach is particularly relevant to studies that have low concentrations of input DNA. It results in a more efficient use of NGS capacity (only the targeted fraction is sequenced) and is an effective selection against nuclear mitochondrial inserts (NUMTS). In contrast to previous studies based in particular on 28S, our results indicate that phylogeny reconstructions based on complete mitogenomes might be more suitable to resolve deep relationships within Stylommatophora. Ancestral gene order reconstructions reveal rearrangements that characterize systematic groups.\n              ", 
"AbstractA 1q42 deletion is a rare structure variation that commonly harbours various deletion breakpoints along with diversified phenotypes. In our study, we found a de novo 1q42 deletion in a boy who did not have a cleft palate or a congenital diaphragmatic hernia but presented with psychomotor retardation. A 1.9 Mb deletion located within 1q42.11-q42.12 was validated at the molecular cytogenetic level. This is the first report of a 1q42.11-q42.12 deletion in a patient with onlypsychomotor retardation. The precise break points could facilitate the discovery of potential causative genes, such as LBR, EPHX1, etc. The correlation between the psychomotor retardation and the underlying genetic factors could not only shed light on the diagnosis of psychomotor retardation at the genetic level but also provide potential therapeutic targets.", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                While orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) is a well-known perennial forage species, rust diseases cause serious reductions in the yield and quality of orchardgrass; however, genetic mechanisms of rust resistance are not well understood in orchardgrass.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology in orchardgrass. A total of 2,334,889 SLAF tags were generated to produce 2,309,777 SNPs. ADMIXTURE analysis revealed unstructured subpopulations for 33 accessions, indicating that this orchardgrass population could be used for association analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed an average r2 of 0.4 across all SNP pairs, indicating a high extent of LD in these samples. Through GWAS, a total of 4,604 SNPs were found to be significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) associated with the rust trait. The bulk analysis discovered a number of 5,211 SNPs related to rust trait. Two candidate genes, including cytochrome P450, and prolamin were implicated in disease resistance through prediction of functional genes surrounding each high-quality SNP (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) associated with rust traits based on GWAS analysis and bulk analysis\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The large number of SNPs associated with rust traits and these two candidate genes may provide the basis for further research on rust resistance mechanisms and marker-assisted selection (MAS) for rust-resistant lineages.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Breeds with small population size are in danger of an increased inbreeding rate and loss of genetic diversity, which puts them at risk for extinction. In Sweden there are a number of local breeds, native breeds which have adapted to specific areas in Sweden, for which efforts are being made to keep them pure and healthy over time. One example of such a breed is the Swedish Gute sheep. The objective of this study was to estimate inbreeding and genetic diversity of Swedish Gute sheep.\n              \n                Results\n                Three datasets were analysed: pedigree information of the whole population, pedigree information for 100 animals of the population, and microsatellite genotypes for 94 of the 100 animals. The average inbreeding coefficient for lambs born during a six year time period (2007–2012) did not increase during that time period. The inbreeding calculated from the entire pedigree (0.038) and for a sample of the population (0.018) was very low. Sheep were more heterozygous at the microsatellite markers than expected (average multilocus heterozygosity and Ritland inbreeding estimates 1.01845 and -0.03931) and five of seven microsatellite markers were not in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium due to heterozygosity excess. The total effective population size estimated from the pedigree information was 155.4 and the average harmonic mean effective population size estimated from microsatellites was 88.3. Pedigree and microsatellite genotype estimations of inbreeding were consistent with a breeding program with the purpose of reducing inbreeding.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Our results showed that current breeding programs of the Swedish Gute sheep are consistent with efforts of keeping this breed viable and these breeding programs are an example for other small local breeds in conserving breeds for the future.\n              ", 
"Abstract\n                Background\n                Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are the method of choice for genetic analyses including diversity and quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies. Marker validation is essential for QTL studies, but the cost and workload are considerable when large numbers of markers need to be verified. Marker systems with low development costs would be most suitable for this task.\n              \n                Results\n                We have tested allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), tetra markers and a genotyping tool based on the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I to verify randomly selected SNP markers identified previously either with a SNP array or by genotyping by sequencing in rice and mungbean, respectively. The genotyping capacity of allele-specific PCR and tetra markers was affected by the sequence context surrounding the SNP; SNPs located in repeated sequences and in GC-rich stretches could not be correctly identified. In contrast, CEL-I digestion of mixed fragments produced from test and reference DNA reliably pinpointed the correct genotypes, yet scoring of the genotypes became complicated when multiple SNPs were present in the PCR fragments. A cost analysis showed that as long the sample number remains small, CEL-I genotyping is more cost-effective than tetra markers.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                CEL-I genotyping performed better in terms of genotyping accuracy and costs than tetra markers.

"Abstract\n                Background\n                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common, complex and severe psychiatric disorder associated with many different genetic and environmental risk factors. Evidence from genetic studies has revealed the role of genome structural variations, specifically copy number variants (CNVs), in the etiology of SCZ. Nevertheless, the occurrence of CNVs and their relation to SCZ has remained relatively unstudied in the diverse Han Chinese population.\n              \n                Results\n                We used a case/control paradigm, including 476 cases and 1023 controls. All samples were genotyped using the Axiom® Exome Genotyping Arrays. Four CNVs, including two deletions and two duplications, were detected in this study. Notably, the 16p11.2 duplication from 29.3 Mb to 29.6 Mb was detected in four cases (0.84%) and one control (0.098%) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0377).\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The results highlight the potential role of these deletions and duplications in the development of SCZ.

This divergence with potentially pathogenic consequences raises a question about cancer susceptibility in the archaic species that was replaced by modern humans about 40,000 years ago.KeywordsBRCA2Tumor suppressorCancerNeanderthalEvolutionMain textThe discovery of tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, commonly known as breast cancer susceptibility genes, has been a major milestone in cancer research, diagnostics, and treatment. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and homologous recombination. High penetrance mutations in these genes result in a loss of tumor suppressor activity and increased risk of breast, ovarian, and, less frequently, other types of cancer [1]. Even though both genes have been known to evolve under rapid positive selection in extant primates [2], we highlight unusual sequence divergence of BRCA2 in Neanderthals, the ancient relatives of modern humans.The availability of two high coverage Neanderthal genomes [3, 4] enables their comparison with human and other primate genomes, which shows that Neanderthal BRCA2 contains three unique non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions in the following positions of chromosome 13: (1) 32911273 (G2781A, M927I), (2) 32911463 (A2971G,N991D, Reference SNP rs1799944), and (3) 32913407 (G4915A, V1639I). All primate species that we used for comparison, i.e. Denisovan, another archaic species whose genome is available [5], modern human (hg19, Ensembl’s GRCh37.74), chimpanzee (CHIMP2.1.4.74), gorilla (gorGor3.1.74), orangutan (PPYG2.74), and gibbon (Nleu1.0.74), shared the same ancestral variant (human reference allele) in each of the three positions. The three Neanderthal loci were monomorphic, with sequence depth between 17 and 52x. Alleles in position (1) and (2) were shared by both Neanderthal individuals, while position (3) was monomorphic for the ancestral allele in the Vindija individual and polymorphic/heterozygous for the Neanderthal-specific allele in the Altai individual.At least one of the Neanderthal variants (position (2)) is likely pathogenic, as the BRCA2 SNP has been recorded by COSMIC database in association with two cancer types, haemangioblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma [6]. However, functional consequences of these changes are unclear. Even though the two variants result in amino acid substitutions (M927I and V1639I), the protein structure is unaffected by these changes, as predicted using the AS2TS platform [7]. Based on the ‘1000 Genome’ database, the allele frequency is low (8%) and varies between populations from 3% (Europeans) to 13% (South Asians). Could thus the presence of this allele in modern humans be explained by interbreeding and introgression from Neanderthals? Only unlikely, as its frequency in Africans (5.5%) is not much lower than the global mean frequency. To our knowledge, the other two Neanderthal variants are absent from modern human populations altogether.We have previously described more than a hundred other species-divergent substitutions in cancer-related genes that were prevalent germline genotypes in some primate species but in humans appeared only as somatic cancerous mutations [8]. These findings suggest that even closely related species may have evolved alternative counter-cancer adaptations, given that the same variant causes cancer in one species but not the other.Abbreviations\n                \n                    BRCA2\n                  : \n                    breast cancer 2 gene\n                  COSMIC: \n                    Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsNot applicable.\n                Funding\n                Not applicable.\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                Not applicable.\n              Authors’ contributionsPM wrote the article, LK analyzed data.

Southern blotting analysis was used to select transgenic plants with single copy. The expression of TaCKX2.4 gene was estimated by Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Finally, the relation between expression of TaCKX2.4 gene and grain numbers was validated.\n              \n                Results\n                Totally, 20 positive independent events were obtained. Homozygous lines from 5 events with a single copy of transformed gene each were selected to evaluate the expression of TaCKX2.4 and grain numbers per spike in T3 generation. Compared with the control NB1, the average grain numbers per spike significantly increased by 12.6%, 8.3%, 6.5% and 5.8% in the T3 lines JW39-3A, JW1-2B, JW1-1A and JW5-1A, respectively.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Our study indicated that the expression level of TaCKX2.4 was negatively correlated with the grain number per spike, indicating that the reduced expression of TaCKX2.4 increased grain numbers per spike in wheat.\n              Keywords\n                CKX2.4\n              Grain number per spikeTransgenic plant\n                Triticum aestivum\n              BackgroundThe plant hormone cytokinin (CK) promotes cell proliferation and differentiation, and regulates plant growth and development from many processes, such as senescence, shoot and root balance, transduction of nutritional signals, leaf senescence, chloroplast formation and crop productivity [1–3]. CK in grains during the early stage of grain development play an important role in regulating grain filling pattern and consequently influence grain filling percentage [4], and CK in the grains may mediate cell division in rice endosperm at early grain filling stages [5]. CK are the most potent general coordinator between the stay-green trait and senescence. Stay-green can not only increase the yield of wheat but also its resistance to heat stress during active photosynthesis [6]. Exogenous cytokinins can sustain longer active photosynthetic period during the grain filling stage, transfer more assimilates to the grain [7], and increase grain yield under heat stress [6]. The increase of photosynthetic productivity can lead to high yields through improvement of leaf anatomical and biochemical traits including tolerance to non-optimal temperature conditions [8].Cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases (CKX) are important in controlling local cytokinin levels and contribute to the regulation of cytokinin-dependent processes [9]. CKX is regarded as a negative regulator of cytokinin [10]. Overexpression of CKX gene led to reduced endogenous cytokinin contents in plants [11].A number of CKX genes were cloned from Zea mays [12], Arabidopsis [13], orchid [14], rice [15], barley and wheat [16–20]. The functions of CKX genes were demonstrated in some plants by transgenic technology. The relationship between CKX and CK has been extensively investigated to understand their functions in plant development. The CKX activity may be induced by the levels of CK [20]. In Arabidopsis, the transgenic plants with an overexpression of AtCKX1 and AtCKX3 had fewer flowers on each inflorescence stem, indicating a reduction in the ability of apical inflorescence meristems to form new flower primordia [13]. In rice, the transgenic plants with low expression level of OsCKX2 had an increased grain numbers, whereas the transgenic plants with a higher expression level of OsCKX2 showed a lower grain numbers. In addition, an OsCKX2 null variety had high grain yield [15]. This suggested that the different transcript levels of OsCKX2 were responsible for the phenotypic differences of these rice varieties [15]. Down-regulation of OsCKX2 expression increased tiller numbers and improved grain weight [21]. Overexpression or suppression of GhCKX (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in transgenic tobacco led to deficiency of cytokinin (e.g., fewer or no flowers) or over-production of cytokinin (e.g., more flowers and capsules) [19]. In addition, silencing of HvCKX1 in transgenic barley resulted in a lower CKX activity and a higher grain yield [17]. So far, there have been no reports of transgenic wheat to prove the function of TaCKX gene.Wheat is one of the most important staple crops worldwide. To study the relationship between the expression level of CKX and wheat productivity, Zhang et al. [19] cloned TaCKX6 and observed that its haplotype variants were significantly associated with the 1000-grain weight based on linkage mapping, association study and gene expression analysis. The expression level of two TaCKX2 genes was significantly correlated with grain numbers per spike [18]. However, the relationship between the CKX gene expression and number of reproductive organs in transgenic plants remains unknown. In the present study, a TaCKX2.4 [22] RNA interference vector (piCKX2.4) was constructed and transformed into immature embryos using the seed inoculation method to validate the function of TaCKX2.4 and the relationship between TaCKX2.4 and grain numbers in bread wheat.Materials and methodsPlant material and preparation of explants\n                Stock plants of NB1 were produced in 17 cm diameter pots, four plants per pot. Plants are grown in KLASMANN compost, a thin layer of medium vermiculite is scattered on top of the compost. Aquamat was used under the pots to keep the moisture. Place pots in a greenhouse at 25 °C day/20 °C night with 16 h photoperiod, 500 µE/m 2 /s.\n              Construction of RNAi interference vector\n                In order to use hairpin construct to generate a higher efficiency of RNA silencing, we selected the conserved domain of TaCKX2.4 (located on chromosome 3A) as the RNAi target sequence. The conserved fragment of 1–495 bp of TaCKX2.4 (JN381555.1) was used to design RNAi hairpin structure. The conserved hairpin was inserted into pBIOS2043 under the regulation of the promoter OsActin 1 and Act 1 intron 1 [23] to construct the plant expression RNAi vector pBIOS2043-TaCKX2.4 (Fig.1).\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        T-DNA region of the plasmid pBIOS2043-TaCKX2\n                      \n              Bacterial strains and culture conditions\n                Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 was used for gene transformation. Agrobacterium cells were cultured on YEP plate with appropriate antibiotic (Kanamycin, 50 mg/L) at 28 °C for 1 d. Then the bacteria was collected, and re-suspended in 3 ml TSIM medium (MS medium 4.41 g/l, Myo-inositol 100 mg/l, MES 50 mg/l, Glucose 10 g/l) with 200 µM Acetosyringone (AS), and the bacterial suspension was transferred into a small universal tube.\n              Plant transformation\n                Wheat immature embryos transformation was performed as described in Risacher et al. [24]. one microlitre bacterial suspension was injected into each immature seed on the spike using a syringe. The injection should be done between the endosperm and the scutellum. After all ears were inoculated, fix a support cane outside the cylinder and cover with a translucent plastic bag sealed at the base. After 2 d co-cultivation at 22 °C, isolate the inoculated seeds and extract the embryos by tweezers and blade, and plate the embryos on W4 rest medium (containing MS medium, 100 mg/l Myo-inositol, 50 mg/l MES and 10 g/l glucose) at 28.5 °C/23 °C (16 h/8 h) for 5 d. In 12 d after isolation, the calli were transferred to the selection medium (W4 added 2.5 ml/l geneticin) at 25.5 °C/23 °C (16 h/8 h), and 2 weeks later, the calli were cut into pieces and transferred to fresh selection medium. After 2 weeks, the calli were transferred to regeneration medium. Regenerated shoots were separated from the calli and transferred onto rooting medium containing MS salts (20 g/l sucrose, 6 g/l agarose, 2.5 ml/l Geneticin and 2 ml/l Kinetin) [24]. Rooted shoots were transplanted into soil and cultured in the greenhouse. The media for calli of controls didn’t have geneticin.\n              Preliminary screening of homozygous transgenic plants with single copy\n                Thirty T1 generation seeds harvested from each T0 transgenic plant were selected randomly and put into 10 ml tubes. Two times volumes of 2 g/l Kanamycin solution were added into the tubes. After being treated at room temperature for 24 h, the seeds were put on the vermiculite to grow at 25 °C. The normal plants from the lines with the ratio of 3 normal to 1 albino plants were selected and transferred them to the soil, grew in the greenhouse with controlled environment at 25 °C/20 °C (16 h/8 h). The seeds of T2 generations were harvested in each individual plant. The T2 generation seeds were treated by Kanamycin according to the method mentioned above [24]. The lines with all normal plants, derived from each T1 plant, should have a single copy. The transgenic lines with a single copy were verified by Southern blotting analysis.\n              Molecular analysis of transformed plants\n                PCR analysis\n                  Transgenic plants were selected by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaf tissues of receptor NB1 and transgenic plants using plant genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The gene-specific primers (5’-ATTCTTATTTCTTTCCAGTAGC and 5’-AGAAGCGGCATAATGTGAGA) were used to amplify an 882-bp fragment of FAD2 intron, a fragment of the interference vector. PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl containing 50 ng of genomic DNA, 2 µl PCR buffer, 0.2 mM of forward and reverse primers, and 1.5 U of Taq polymerase using a PCR Reaction Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). The PCR reaction included DNA denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 38 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Only the positive transgenic plants can be amplified the expected size, because the FAD2 was the fragment of the vector. In order to confirm the band, we sequenced the amplified product.\n                Southern blotting analysis\n                  Genomic DNA was extracted from leaves of T3 transgenic plants with single copies selected preliminarily by Kana and non-transgenic plants using plant genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China). About 20 µg of DNA was successfully digested with 5 U of EcoRV and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The digested genomic DNA fragments were separated on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel, and transferred onto Zeta-Probe GT nylon membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The DNA fragments were fixed to the membrane by UV cross linking. The 882-bp PCR fragment of FAD2 intron was labeled with digoxin. The probe labeling, hybridization, washing and detection procedures were performed according to instructions of the DIG High prime DNA labeling and Detection Starter KitII (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).\n                Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis\n                  RNA was extracted from leaves of transgenic plants and the control NB1 using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and reverse transcription of RNA was performed using M-MLV RTase Synthesis Kit (Takara, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Rotor-Gene 3000 Series real time DNA amplification system under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 20 s. Melting curve analysis was performed at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 97 °C, continuous, using the TaCKX2.4-specific primers (5’-TGTCGGTCGAAGGCCAGTA and 5’-TAGTCGGTCCACGA ACGC). Melting curve analysis was included to verify the specificity of DNA amplification. Expression of the reference gene tubulin, served as quantifying control, was monitored using gene-specific forward and reverse primers (5’-AACTTCGCCCGTGGTCAT and 5’-CAGCGTTGAATACAAGGAATC) under the same condition as that of TaCKX2.4. Three biological replicates were performed for each line and three technical replicates were analyzed for each biological replicate.\n                Agronomic traits of T3 transgenic plants\n                  Five single-copy transgenic lines and the control NB1 were grown in the isolated field for genetically modified organism (GMO) in Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shandong, China. Field trials were conducted in completely randomized blocks with three replicates. Each plot consisted of four 4-m rows with 30 cm between rows and 20 cm between plants. The data for spike length (SL), spikelet number per spike (SPN) and grain number per spike (GN) were measured from the main spikes of ten randomly selected plants each plot. SL was the length from the neck node to the top of the spike (did not include the length of awn). Thousand-grain weight (TGW) was measured as the average weight of two independent samples of 1000 grains. The kernel length and kernel width were recorded for 20 randomly selected kernels from each line in triplicate, and the average value was used for subsequent analysis [25].\n                ResultsWheat transformation and PCR analysis\n                The TaCKX2.4 RNA interference vector (PiCKX2.4) was transformed into immature embryos of wheat line ‘NB1’ by Agrobacterium. There were 22 putative transgenic plants from 22 independent transgenic lines. In order to avoid the interference of endogenous genes in wheat, the presence of PiCKX2.4 vector in the putative transgenic plants was determined by genomic DNA PCR with the primers specific to FAD2 intron, a fragment of the interference vector. Twenty of 22 primary transformants that could amplify an 882-bp targeting band were PCR-positive (Fig.2), whereas the negative control had no amplified fragments.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        PCR detection of 22 putative transgenic plants. 1~<U+2009>22 are putative transgenic plants, positive control (plasmid DNA as template, CK+) and negative control (non-transgenic plants, CK-)\n                      \n              Southern analysis of T0 transgenic wheat and homozygous transgenic plants with single copy\n                Based on the preliminary results of PCR analysis, representative T0 transgenic lines were selected for gene integration analysis. Southern blotting analysis indicated that the FAD2 intron on the T-DNA were integrated into the wheat genome at single copies in the JW41-1B, JW1-2B, JW1-1A, JW5-1A and JW39-3A transgenic lines (Fig. 3).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Southern blotting analysis in selected T0 primary wheat transformants.

Lane 1 is WT (NB1), lanes 2~<U+2009>6 are JW1-1A, JW5-1A, JW41-1B, JW39-3A and JW1-2B, respectively, M is the marker: <U+03BB>-EcoT14 I digest (TaKaRa, Dalian, China)\n                      \n                In order to obtain homozygous transgenic plants with a single copy, 30 seeds from per T0 transgenic plant with a single copy were treated by 2 g/L Kana solution. The results showed that five lines had a 3:1 segregation of normal to albino plants, confirming that the five T0 transgenic plants were with single copy. Thirty seeds from per T1 normal line were treated by 2 g/L Kanamycin solution. Five lines with no segregation were homozygous and selected for subsequent analysis. PCR for T1 to T3 transgenic lines showed that PiCKX2.4 was stably inherited.\n              \n                           TaCKX2.4 expression in transgenic wheat with single copy\n                The expression of TaCKX2.4 in leaves of T3 lines from selected primary transformants with single copy was analyzed by qRT-PCR using specific primers. There was variation in the expression level of TaCKX2.4 among the five selected transformants. In general, the TaCKX2.4 transcript levels were much lower in the transformants than in controls (Fig. 4). Among them, the lines JW39-3A and JW1-2B had the lowest expression of TaCKX2.4, 0.19 and 0.24, respectively, relative to the control. Only the line JW41-1B had no significantly different expression from that of the control, which could be attributed to the low expression of shRNA-CKX2.4 in this transgenic line. Overall, the shRNA-CKX2.4 introduced into the wheat genome resulted in reduced expression of TaCKX2.4 in these transgenic lines.\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Relative expression of TaCKX2 in wild type (NB1) and selected T3 transgenic lines by qRT-PCR.

The field trials showed no significant differences in spike length, number of spikelet per spike, kernel length, kernel width and TGW between transgenic and control plants. However, the grain numbers per spike from main tiller of transgenic plants were significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) increased by 5.8–12.6% on average compared with those of non-transformed plants (Table 1 and Fig. 5).Table 1\n                        Comparison of phenotypes between transgenic lines and the control NB1\n                      LineSpike length (cm)Kernel width (mm)Kernel length (mm)Thousand-grain weight (g)Grain numbers per spikeIncreased grain numbers per spike (%)JW41-1B10.9 a3.40a6.90 a31.1 a56.0 a–JW1-1A11.0 a3.35a6.75a29.5 a59.2 b6.5JW39-3A11.6 a3.40 a7.00 a30.6 a62.6 c12.6JW5-1A10.7 a3.45a6.75 a29.1 a58.8 b5.8JW1-2B11.1 a3.45 a6.75 a29.1 a60.2 b8.3NB110.8 a3.40 a7.00 a30.9 a55.6 a–\n                      Different lowercase letters following the values indicate significant differences (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05)\n                    \n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Grain numbers per spike from main tiller in NB1 and five transgenic lines.

The expression of TaCKX2.4 in the five transgenic plants was lower than that in the control (Fig. 4). The expression level of TaCKX2.4 was negatively correlated with grain numbers per spike, indicating that the reduced expression of TaCKX2.4 increased grain numbers in wheat (Fig. 6).\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        The trendline for the relation between relative expression of TaCKX2 and grain numbers per spike from main tiller in NB1, JW41-1B, JW5-1A, JW1-1A, JW1-2B and JW39-3A\n                      \n              DiscussionThe aim of the current study was to specifically down regulate the expression of TaCKX2.4 using shRNA-mediated gene silencing to examine its influence on wheat yield-related traits. Here we showed that iRNA-TaCKX2.4 transgenic wheat lines expressed the shRNA efficiently and specifically reduced the expression of homologous TaCKX2.4 (Fig. 4), consistent with those of transgenic rice and barley plants that harbored hairpin (hp) RNA-expression constructs containing rice OsCKX2 sequences [21], and barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV sequences [26], and partial cDNA fragments of HvCKX1 [17], resulting in blockage of the translation of target mRNAs into proteins. Our results showed that PiCKX2.4 was stably inherited in transgenic lines. The iRNA-TaCKX2.4 transgenic lines in this study contained one copy of the silencing genes in the genome (Fig. 3), conferring an efficient reduction of TaCKX2.4 transcript in all lines except for JW41-1B (Fig. 4).Because CKX is the only known enzyme responsible for irreversible degradation of cytokinins in plants, mutant or transgenic plants with low expressing levels of CKX genes have been shown to possess a clear cytokinin-overproducing phenotype. Recent genetic transformation studies suggest that crop productivity can be enhanced by decreasing the expression of CKX gene [21]. Decreased expression of OsCKX2 in transgenic rice by anti-sense also leads to increased grain numbers per panicle [15]. There were more capsules in transgenic CKX-suppression tobacco plants than in control [27].In wheat, the relationship between the expression of CKX gene and the number of reproductive organs has not been confirmed by a direct validation via gene transformation before. Here we investigated the relationship between the expression level of TaCKX2.4 gene and the grain number per spike, spike length, thousand-grain weight, seed length and seed width in transgenic wheat plants with TaCKX2.4 RNA interference vector. The results showed a significantly negative correlation between the expression of TaCKX2.4 and grain numbers, consistent with those in rice [21] and Arabidopsis thaliana [13], but opposite to previous results obtained in wheat where the increasing of TaCKX2.1/TaCKX2.2 expression could lead to the increase of grain number per spike [18]. Decreased expression of the TaCKX1, TaCKX2 and TaCKX6 may lead to the accumulation of CK in NIL31 (TaGW2-6A allelic variants) [28]. The TaCKX2.4 RNA interference vector reduced the activity of the cytokinin oxidase in transgenic plants, which caused accumulation of cytokinin in inflorescence meristems and increased the number of reproductive organs, leading to increasing grain numbers per spike.In wheat,five TaCKX2 genes were reported, and they were located on the short arms of the group 3 chromosome [18, 22]. TaCKX2.4 was mapped on chromosome 3A, TaCKX2.5 was mapped on chromosome 3B, and TaCKX2.1, TaCKX2.2 and TaCKX2.3 were mapped on chromosome 3D [18, 22]. Alignment of the CDS and amino acid of TaCKX2.4 with TaCKX2.1, TaCKX2.2, TaCKX2.3 and TaCKX2.5 showed sequence identity of 93%, 93%, 85% and 85%, respectively, and 92%, 91%, 80% and 80%, respectively. High sequence identity indicates that they have similar biological functions [18].To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to verify the function of TaCKX2.4 in wheat, where an efficient suppression of TaCKX2.4 is successfully achieved by shRNAi.ConclusionThis study constructed a plant expression RNAi vector pBIOS2043-TaCKX2.4 and obtained five transgenic wheat lines with single copies of transformed targeting gene using the infection of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. The positive transgenic plants had significantly lower expression of TaCKX2.4 and higher grain numbers per spike than the control NB1. It was shown that the reduced expression of TaCKX2.4 significantly increased grain numbers in wheat.NotesYulian Li and Guoqi Song contributed equally to this work.Abbreviations\n                AS: \n                    Acetosyringone\n                  CK: \n                    Cytokinin\n                  CKX: \n                    Cytokinin oxidases/dehydrogenases\n                  GMO: \n                    Genetically modified organism\n                  GN: \n                    Grain number per spike\n                  qRT-PCR: \n                    Quantitative real-time PCR\n                  SL: \n                    Spike length\n                  SPN: \n                    Spikelet number per spike\n                  TGW: \n                    Thousand-grain weight\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Youth Foundation of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (2014QNZ02), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31401378, 31501312, 31701428 and 31601301), Science and Technology Development Plan of Shandong Province (2014GSF121001), Genetically Modified Organisms Breeding Major Project (2016ZX08002003), Key Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province(2017GNC10113), Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CXGC2016C09), the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2014CM006), the youth Talent Program of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Youth of Foundation of Crop Research Institute of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences.\n                Funding\n                This work was supported by the Youth Foundation of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (2014QNZ02), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31401378, 31501312, 31701428 and 31601301), Science and Technology Development Plan of Shandong Province (2014GSF121001), Genetically Modified Organisms Breeding Major Project (2016ZX08002003), Key Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province(2017GNC10113), Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CXGC2016C09), the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2014CM006), the youth Talent Program of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Youth of Foundation of Crop Research Institute of Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences.\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                The authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.\n              Authors’ contributionsYL transformed the target gene and wrote the paper; GS did the southern blotting analysis; JG transformed the target gene; SZ constructed the vector; RZ analyzed the data; WL detected the transgenic plants; MC was responsible for plant cultivation and management; ML was in charge of the survey of agronomic traits; XX was revised the article; TR constructed the vector; GL conceived the study.

One possible reason is the limited ability to detect disease causal structural variants (SVs) from short reads sequencing technologies. Long reads sequencing can produce longer reads (typically 1000 bp or longer), therefore offering greatly improved ability to detect SVs that may be missed by short-read sequencing.\n              \n                Results\n                Here we describe a case study, where WES identified only one heterozygous pathogenic variant for an individual suspected to have glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia), which is an autosomal recessive disease caused by bi-allelic mutations in the G6PC gene. Through Nanopore long-read whole-genome sequencing, we identified a 7.1 kb deletion covering two exons on the other allele, suggesting that complex structural variants (SVs) may explain a fraction of cases when the second pathogenic allele is missing from WES on recessive diseases. Both breakpoints of the deletion are within Alu elements, and we designed Sanger sequencing and quantitative PCR assays based on the breakpoints for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for the family planning on another child. Four embryos were obtained after in vitro fertilization (IVF), and an embryo without deletion in G6PC was transplanted after PGD and was confirmed by prenatal diagnosis, postnatal diagnosis, and subsequent lack of disease symptoms after birth.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                In summary, we present one of the first examples of using long-read sequencing to identify causal yet complex SVs in exome-negative patients, which subsequently enabled successful personalized PGD.\n              KeywordsWhole-exome sequencingWESStructural variantsLong-read sequencingG6PCPGDGSD-IaBackgroundWhole exome sequencing (WES) is now widely used in genetic testing on patients who are suspected or have been clinically demonstrated to have genetic disorders. However, a large proportion (~<U+2009>60–70%) of patients judged clinically to have a Mendelian disease receive negative results on WES with current Illumina short-read sequencing technology [1–5]. Compared to WES, the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) does not appear to significantly improve the diagnostic yield [6, 7] or present much economic advantage [8]. Therefore, WES/WGS-negative cases pose a significant challenge to the clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases. Several reasons may explain the lack of positive findings, such as the inefficiency of template DNA capture, the biases in sequencing coverage, the failure to call causal variants from data, the inability to catalog all functional variants (especially non-coding variants), the incorrect clinical interpretation of genetic variants, the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease in certain patients and the possibility of disease causal mechanisms due to somatic or epigenetic origin. Among these reasons, the limited ability to interrogate repeat elements such as tandem repeats [9] and structural variants (SVs) [10] may play important roles. Clinical microarrays such as SNP arrays or array-CGH can detect relatively large deletions and duplications [11–14], but have difficulty to reliably identify small (<<U+2009>10 kb) exonic deletions or complex SVs in clinical settings [15]. Furthermore, several published studies demonstrated examples where disease causal SVs were missed by short-read WES/WGS [16], or that certain classes of disease causal repeats failed to be identified by WES/WGS [17]. In particular, conventional short-reads sequencing approaches have been reported to lack sensitivity, exhibit very high false positive rate, and misinterpret complex or nested SVs [18].Long-read sequencing technologies, such as the 10X Genomics linked-read sequencing, the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and PacBio single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, offer complementary strengths to traditional WES/WGS based on short-read sequencing. Long-read sequencing can produce read length (typically 1000 bp or longer) that is far higher than the 100-150 bp produced by short-read sequencing, therefore allowing for the resolution of breakpoints of complex SVs [19] or the detection of long tandem repeats [20, 21]. In particular, recent de novo human genome assemblies via long-read sequencing have revealed tens of thousands of SVs per genome, several times more than previously observed via WGS, suggesting an underestimation of the extent and complexity of SVs [22–25].In the present study, we applied a long-read whole-genome sequencing to yield the genetic diagnosis of glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) in a patient whose causal variants were unsolved by Sanger sequencing and WES. Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD-I) is a group of autosomal recessive metabolic diseases caused by defects in the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) complex, with an overall incidence of approximately 1:20,000–40,000 cases per live birth [26, 27]. The most common form, GSD-Ia, represents more than 80% of GSD-I cases [28]. Mutations in the G6PC gene have been found to be the cause of this disease. The G6PC comprises of five exons on chromosome 17q21, and encodes a 35 kD monomeric protein, the G6Pase catalytic subunit, which plays a role in the endoplasmic reticulum [29, 30]. Through Sanger sequencing and WES, we were able to identify one deleterious mutation in the proband, yet we suspected the presence of a complex SV due to the observation of Mendelian inconsistency in the family. As a result of long-read sequencing, we made a positive diagnosis of GSD-Ia on the patient and accurately identified the breakpoints of a causal SV in the other allele of the G6PC gene, which further guided genetic counseling in the family and enabled a successful preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for in vitro fertilization (IVF) on the family.MethodsPatient characteristics\n                The study was approved by the CITIC-Xiangya Reproductive and Genetics Hospital, Central South University. The collection and use of tissues followed procedures that are in accordance with ethical standards as formulated in the Helsinki Declaration, and informed consent was obtained from the study participants. The proband was a 12 year old boy with hepatosplenomegaly and growth retardation, and was diagnosed with possible GSD-Ia in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in 2017 (Table 1). The parents of the proband came to Xiangya Hospital to seek help to have another child via IVF, but genetic testing by Sanger sequencing and whole-exome sequencing (WES) failed to identify a definitive genetic cause of the disease in the family. Indeed, a homozygous mutation of c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A (p.C109Y) in exon 2 of the G6PC gene was identified via WES and was interpreted to be likely pathogenic. However, Sanger sequencing showed that the mother is a carrier, yet the father does not carry the mutation, therefore complicating genetic counseling on the family and subsequent design of PGD on the proposed IVF.Table 1\n                        Biochemical indicators of the proband suggest a probable diagnosis of GSD-Ia\n                      ParameterTested valueReference rangeResultGlucose (mmol/L)0.17<U+2193>3.6–6.1AbnormalCO2 (mmol/L)7.1<U+2193>19–33AbnormalSodium (mmol/L)132.7135–153 Chlorinum (mmol/L)89.2<U+2193>96–108AbnormalCalcium (mmol/L)2.652–2.6 Total bile acid (µmol/L)16.7<U+2191>0–12AbnormalALT (IU/L)257.4<U+2191>7–56AbnormalAST (IU/L)357.6<U+2191>0–40AbnormalTriglyceride (mmol/L)5.74<U+2191>0.52–1.56AbnormalHDL (mmol/L)2.01<U+2191>0.88–1.76Abnormal\n                      Abbreviations: ALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, HDL high-density lipoproteins\n                    \n              Long-read sequencing by Oxford Nanopore technology\n                Due to the presence of Mendelian inconsistency on the c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A mutation, and that sperm sequencing on the father was inconclusive, we suspected that a SV may have encompassed the exon but with breakpoints in non-exonic regions, evading detection by whole-exome sequencing. Due to the complex genomic architecture around this gene, we decided to sequence the patient by low-coverage long-read sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform. Genomic DNA was extracted and large insert-size libraries were created according to the manufacturer recommended protocols (Oxford Nanopore, UK). Five µg genomic DNA was sheared to ~<U+2009>5-25 kb fragments using Megaruptor (Diagenode, B06010002), size selected (10-30 kb) with a BluePippin (Sage Science, MA) to ensure removal of small DNA fragments. Subsequently, genomic libraries were prepared using the Ligation sequencing 1D kit SQK-LSK108 (Oxford Nanopore, UK). End-repair and dA-tailing of DNA fragments according to protocol recommendations was performed using the Ultra II End Prep module (NEB, E7546L). At last, the purified dA tailed sample, blunt/TA ligase master mix (#M0367, NEB), tethered 1D adapter mix using SQK-LSK108 were incubated and purified. Libraries were sequenced on R9.4 flowcells using GridION X5. Four GridION flowcells generated 2,251,269 base-called reads containing 35,595,548,336 bases with an average read length of 16,579 bp. We used NGMLR [31] to align the long reads to the human reference genome (GRCh37). Structural variations (SVs) were called by Sniffles [31] and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called by SAMtools [32] for comparison to WES results. Ribbon [33] and IGV [34] were used to visualize the alignment results and manually validate possible SV calls.\n              Sanger sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR\n                Sanger sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were conducted to validate the long-read sequencing result in the family. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes using QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The exons of the G6PC gene as well as the potential breakpoint junction were amplified using PCR primers (Table 2). Each PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 40 µl containing 20 µl of GoTaq® 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>Green Master Mix, 0.8 µl of 10 mM/l mixture of forward and reverse primers, 1.5 µl of 80 ng/µl genomic DNA template, and 17.6 µl of nuclease-free water. The PCR was conducted under the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s followed by a final elongation of 5 mins, and PCR products were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. The exons of the G6PC gene were also quantitatively tested using quantitative RT-PCR (Table 2). Data were analyzed using the <U+25B3><U+25B3>CT method.Table 2\n                        Primers for Sanger sequencing.

The amplification primers for the ß-globin gene are: Primer ß-F: 5’-TGAGTCTATGGGACGCTTGA-3' and Primer ß-R: 5’-ATCCAGCCTTATCCCAACC-3'. The primers designed to amplify the sequence near the breakpoint were G6PC-DEL-F: 5’-GAGTTAGAAGGAGATGGCGGG-3' and G6PC-DEL-R: 5’-GGCCTATCCTACATATTAATAGTT-3' which generates a target fragment of 418 bp.\n              Assessment of pathogenicity of the mutations\n                We analyzed the WES data through the variant filtering pipelines implemented in the ANNOVAR software [35], by focusing on coding variants and by removing common variants observed in the gnomAD database. We identified a novel and homozygous missense mutation (c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A; p.C109Y) in the G6PC gene. The novel missense mutation has not been recorded in the HGMD version 2017.4 (http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php) or in the dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) database. According to the ACMG-AMP 2015 Standards and Guidelines [36], and facilitated by the InterVar software tool [37], we analyzed the pathogenicity of the novel mutation and determined that it is a likely pathogenic mutation responsible for the disease manifestation. No other candidate genes were found in our WES analysis that may explain the observed phenotypes of the proband.\n              In vitro fertilization (IVF) and pre-implementation genetic diagnosis (PGD)\n                The parents of the proband had genetic counseling at the Reproductive & Genetic Hospital of CITIC-Xiangya, and proceeded with in vitro fertilization (IVF). A total of four oocytes were retrieved; all were in metaphase II, and all of them were inseminated (day 0) by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The embryos were cultured to blastocyst stage, and 2–3 zona pellucida cells were used to detect mutations in the G6PC gene, and the embryos were also scored according to the Istanbul consensus [38] (Additional file 1: Table S1). PGD was performed using assays designed for detecting both the missense mutation and the exonic deletion in G6PC. The best embryo scored by the Istanbul consensus [38] was selected for implementation after PGD.\n              ResultsClinical examination\n                We were presented with a 12 year-old boy with hepatosplenomegaly and growth retardation at the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Hunan, China in 2017 (Fig. 1a). The clinical features include a rounded doll’s face, fatty cheeks and protuberant abdomen (Fig. 1b). Based on examination on the proband’s skeletal development by X-rays, his hip and wrist showed osteoporosis (Fig. 1c, d). In the upper liver, right intercostal midline sixth intercostal, liver rib length is 51 mm, thickness is 37 mm. Maximum oblique diameter of right liver is 159 mm, suggesting severe liver enlargement (Fig. 1d). Spleen is swollen to a thickness of 34 mm.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Clinical characteristics of the proband. (a) Pedigree of the family.

(e) Image of type-B ultrasonic on the proband shows severe liver enlargement. Blue color: The blood flow away from the detector of ultrasound B-mode scanner; Red color: The blood flow to the detector of ultrasound B-mode scanner\n                      \n                Additional biochemical assays were performed on the proband (Table 1). His fasting blood glucose value was 0.17 mmol/l, which had reached a dangerously low value. Levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and chlorinum were abnormal. Investigation of liver function showed elevated aminotransferases (AST, ALT) and other biochemical abnormalities. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin were at normal levels. Altogether, these clinical and biochemical examinations indicated that the boy is likely to be affected with GSD-Ia.\n                The parents were non-consanguineous, and neither has any symptom of GSD-Ia (Fig. 1a). They came to Xiangya Hospital to seek help to obtain a genetic diagnosis and plan to have another child by in vitro fertilization (IVF). Given that GSD-Ia is a recessive disease, we hypothesized that the proband carries bi-allelic G6PC mutations inherited from the father and mother, respectively. Yielding a confirmed genetic diagnosis and determining the exact disease causal variants are necessary to perform preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) from in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n              Whole-exome and sanger sequencing identified one pathogenic variant\n                To confirm the clinical diagnosis, we conducted clinical exome sequencing on the proband. A novel missense mutation of the G6PC gene (c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A) was identified by WES (Fig. 2a), which appears to be homozygous and affects a highly conserved position in the protein sequence (Fig. 2b). Bioinformatics analysis by InterVar [37] and manual examination of the ACMG-AMP 2015 guidelines [36] determined the mutation to be likely pathogenic. We further validated the mutation by Sanger sequencing on all family members (Fig. 2c). However, the mutation was not detected in the father and was present in a heterozygous state in the mother (Fig. 2c). In order to examine whether germline mosaicism is present in the father, the DNA of the father’s sperm was sequenced, but the results were largely inconclusive as a small peak for A allele and an even smaller peak for C allele is present at the c.326 position (Additional file 1: Figure S1).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Identification of a c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A missense mutation in the G6PC gene. (a) Whole-exome sequencing identified a homozygous c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A missense variant in exon 2 of the G6PC gene. (b) The amino acid 109 (marked by red color) affected by c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A is highly conserved across different species. (c) Sanger sequencing on the pedigree showed that the father does not carry the c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A missense variant and that the mother carries a heterozygous c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A missense variant\n                      \n              Long-read sequencing identified a structural variant in the other allele\n                To evaluate whether a structural variant is present in the proband that masks the c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A mutation as homozygous, we carried out long-read whole-genome sequencing on the proband using the Oxford Nanopore technology. We generated 2,251,269 base-called reads containing 35,595,548,336 bases (~12X whole-genome coverage) with an average read length of 16,579 bp. Using the long-read sequencing data, a novel deletion on chr17 g.41049904_41057049del7146 (GRCh37) was detected in one allele of G6PC (Fig. 3a), and the known heterozygous point mutation c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A was detected in the other allele. This deletion was supported by four reads, though with slightly discordant breakpoints due to possible alignment errors. The deletion completely covers the first two exons of the G6PC gene, thus resulting in loss of function.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Long-read sequencing identified a deletion in the G6PC gene. (a) IGV screen shot of reads at the G6PC locus. Four reads carry a deletion (chr17 g.41049904_41057049del7125 that starts from the first intron of the LINC00671 gene to intron 2 of the G6PC gene. (b) Quantitative PCR validation of the deletion in the trio. Relative quantitation (RQ) of copy number was analyzed by the <U+0394><U+0394>CT method, and error bars represent standard deviation. The deletion includes exon 1F (5'-Flanking introns), exon 1 and exon 2, and the patient and his father are mutation carriers while his mother is normal. (c) Sanger validation of the deletion breakpoints. The first sequence shows the mutated genomic segment, while the second and third sequences show expected genomic segments if deletion is not present. The red arrow refers to the breakpoint, and a 7125 bp sequence is deleted based on the human reference genome (GRCh37). (d) Depiction of the protein domains that were targeted by the non-synonymous mutation and the 7.1 kb deletion. (e) Illustration of the genomic contexts of the two breakpoints, which are both located in known Alu elements. (f) Gel electrophoresis of the PCR product designed to detect the deletion. The lane marked with M represent GeneRuler 50 bp DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific™), and all lanes (except “-“lane) include an ~<U+2009>800 bp internal control (ß-Globin gene). A 418 bp fragment can be amplified from the father and the proband\n                      \n                By quantitative RT-PCR, we estimated the copy number of each exon of the G6PC gene from the proband and his parents (Fig. 3b). The copy numbers of deletion exon 1F (5'-Flanking region), exon 1 and exon 2 were only about half of the value of the control group, which indicated that the patient and his father both carry a heterozygous deletion.\n                To further clarify the location of the breakpoint of this large deletion, we designed six breakpoint primers (Table 1) to amplify and sequence the suspected breakpoint region. The result confirmed our prediction and found the breakpoints precisely at chr17:41049879 and chr17:41057003 (Fig. 3c). These breakpoints were only 20-50 bp different from the predictions from the long-read sequencing data. This large deletion (chr17 g.41049879_41057003del7125) was thus 7125 bp in length and contains the 5' regulatory sequence as well as exon 1, intron 1, exon 2 and partial intron 2 of the G6PC gene (Fig. 3d). Motif analysis was performed and found that the 5' breakpoint was located in AluJr and the 3' breakpoint in AluSx (Fig. 3e). The Alu family members have a sequence similarity of over 87% and cover 11% of the human genome [39], and Alu-Alu recombination usually produces a fragment deletion via Alu recombination-mediated deletion (ARMD) [40, 41]. Note that WES missed this deletion and judged the heterozygous missense mutation as homozygous, since we were unable to observe any obvious coverage differences between the several exons in the gene from WES (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the patient inherited the missense mutation (c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A) from his mother and inherited the deletion mutation (chr17 g.41049879_41057003del7125) from his father. We further designed a PCR-based assay to easily differentiate samples with and without deletion using a set of primers (G6PC-Del-F/G6PC-Del-R), which generates a 418 bp target fragments in individuals carrying the deletion (Fig. 3f).\n              Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and implantation of the embryo\n                In order to help the family to plan for another child, a reproductive intervention was carried out by in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). To avoid the allelic drop-out (ADO), microsatellite markers D17S760 (location 5' of G6PC, -<U+2009>0.9 M), DS17S793 (location 5' of G6PC, -<U+2009>0.7 M) and DS17S951 (location 3' of G6PC, 0.8 M) in linkage with the breakpoint junction and the point mutations were tested. Four embryos developed to blastocysts, and were collected and biopsied. The deletion mutation (chr17 g.41049879_41057003del7125) was not detected in four embryos, and we ruled out the possibility of allelic drop-out via linkage analysis by microsatellite markers. However, all the four embryos were identified to be carriers of the missense mutation (c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A). Data on the STR sites D17S760, DS17S793 and DS17S951 also indicated that the embryo inherited the maternal risk chromosome (Additional file 1: Table S2). Furthermore, three alleles of D17S760 were found in embryo No. 2, suggesting that it may be partial trisomy in chromosome 17. Considering the state of the four embryos comprehensively, embryo No. 1 was implanted (Additional file 1: Table S1).\n                After the implantation of the embryo, the patient’s mother succeeded in pregnancy and came to our hospital for a review at the 19+ week of pregnancy. We obtained amniotic fluid cells of the fetus to extract DNA. The genetic testing confirmed that the fetus is a carrier of the missense mutation (c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A), and does not inherit the deleterious deletion. The newborn was revisited in our hospital in December 2017. The baby had a fasting blood glucose level of 5.5 mmol/L and her B-ultrasonogram showed that the liver and kidneys were normal (Additional file 1: Figure S2), confirming that she was not affected with GSD-Ia.\n              DiscussionIn the current study, we performed genetic diagnosis on an affected subject with suspected GSD-Ia through clinical whole-exome sequencing and long-read whole-genome sequencing. The proband was misidentified as a homozygote for the c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A mutation by WES, but later confirmed to be a compound heterozygous carrier of the c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A mutation and a 7.1 kb deletion spanning this point mutation. The missense mutation and the deletion were inherited from the mother and father, respectively. Therefore, through combined exome sequencing and long-read whole-genome sequencing, we yielded a definitive genetic diagnosis on the proband, and used this information to design assays to enable successful personalized preimplantation genetic diagnosis following IVF.After we identified the two causal mutations, we also retrospectively examined the exome sequencing data to understand why the deletion was not found previously. All exons in the G6PC gene were covered well in the exome data: the mean depth for exon 1, exon 2, exon 3, exon 4 and exon 5 were 123, 74, 119, 190 and 259, respectively. However, due to the large variability of coverage between exons, and due to the presence of two intronic breakpoints, we did not determine that a deletion covering exon 1 and exon 2 was present from the short-read sequencing data. If we had performed qPCR assays on each exon after WES, we could have identified the deletion that covers exon 1 and 2; nevertheless, we still cannot find the exact breakpoint from WES or qPCR data, yet knowing the exact breakpoint will be important for the purpose of PGD.The human G6PC gene is a single-copy gene that contains five exons and spans 12.5 kb of DNA on chromosome 17q21 [42]. The G6PC gene encodes G6Pase which is a 357 amino acid protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with nine transmembrane domains [43]. The amino-terminus of the protein lies in the ER lumen with the enzymatic active site and the carboxyl-terminus in the cellular cytoplasm [26, 44]. Based on the predicted structure on UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P35575), the novel point mutation (c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A; p.C109Y) detected in this study is located in the lumen of the ER and the deletion fragment (chr17:g.41049879_41057003del7125) contains at least five transmembrane domains. Since the deletion spans the starting codon of the protein, the allele carrying the deletion should not to be transcribed or translated.To date, differential diagnosis of GSD generally relies on the molecular analysis and has replaced the traditional liver biopsy [28, 44]. Detection and analysis of suspicious disease-causing mutations have become a powerful tool for differential diagnosis of GSD and can guide the implementation of PGD and the personalized treatment even further. WES has gradually become a powerful means by which clinicians and scientists can detect the underlying cause of various genetic diseases. However, a major shortcoming of WES is uneven coverage of sequence reads over the capture regions, contributing to many low coverage regions, which hinders accurate variant calling [45]. This challenge did not affect our study per se, since we were able to identify the c.326G<U+2009>><U+2009>A mutation from WES accurately, but the uneven coverage from exome sequencing prevented us from finding the deletion covering two exons. Nevertheless, given that this mutation is a very rare mutation (not documented in public databases) and that there is no known consanguinity in the family, it is unlikely that the proband inherits both alleles from parents. Initially we suspected that the father carries germline mosaicism, yet sperm sequencing on the father did not fully resolve the question (Additional file 1: Figure S1). A low coverage long-read whole-genome sequencing resolved this issue. A large deletion (initially designated as chr17:g.41049904_41057049del7146 based on alignment) was detected in the proband and his father. Then we conducted the Sanger sequencing and the quantitative RT-PCR to validate this result and refine the exact position of the breakpoint junction (chr17:g.41049879_41057003del7125). The slight inconsistence of the deletion breakpoints between initial long-read sequencing and subsequent Sanger sequencing were likely due to the higher error rate of long-read sequencing and the imperfect alignment of the reads. Long-read sequencing can identify complex SVs effectively, thus compensated for the shortcomings of WES and avoided a misdiagnosis and potential failure of PGD.ConclusionIn summary, we present one of the first examples of using long-read sequencing to identify causal yet complex structural variants (SVs) in exome-negative patients, which subsequently enabled successful personalized preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Our study suggests that long-read sequencing offers a means to discover overlooked genetic variation in patients undiagnosed or misdiagnosed by short-read sequencing, and may potentially improve diagnostic yields in clinical settings, especially when only one pathogenic mutation is found in an affected individual suspected to carry a recessive disease.NotesHefan Miao and Jiapeng Zhou contributed equally to this work.Abbreviations\n                ACMG: \n                    The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\n                  G6PC: \n                    glucose-6-phosphatase\n                  GSD: \n                    Glycogen storage disease\n                  GSD-Ia: \n                    Glycogen storage disease type Ia\n                  HGMD: \n                    Human gene mutation database\n                  IVF: \n                    In-vitro fertilization\n                  PCR: \n                    Polymerase chain reaction\n                  PGD: \n                    Preimplantation genetic diagnosis\n                  WES: \n                    Whole exome sequencing\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsWe thank the patient and his family members for participating in this study.

In addition, the relationships between morphological variation and soil nutrient and climate factors were analyzed.\n              \n                Results\n                Analysis of variance, divesity examination and Mantel correlation test detected a significant effect of latitude on morphological traits. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis clearly separated the selected populations into four groups according to latitude. Larger morphological sizes of C. dactylon appeared at the low- and high-latitude regions. Correlation analysis indicated that high morphological variations were significantly correlated with climate factors and soil nutrient.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                This study suggests morphological variation of wild bermudagrass is greatly influenced by latitude as well as soil and climate, which could be useful resources for genetic studies and evolution.\n              Keywords\n                Cynodon dactylon\n              MorphologyVariationLatitudeSoil nutrientBackgroundMorphological plasticity may be of critical importance for resource acquisition by plants [1]. They change their growth form to become more flexible in favorable habitat. The morphological and developmental diversity between taxa and within each taxon is vast. Phenotypic variation observed for plants is generally a response to differences in climatic conditions that reflects adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity [2–6]. The Cynodon species is enormously variable and has become truly cosmopolitan which is originated and diversified somewhere from West Pakistan to Turkey(i.e., Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and the West part of Pakistan) and distributed in all countries and islands between about lat 45°N and lat 45°S and penetrates to approximately lat 53°N in Europe. Perennial Bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] of the tribe Chlorideae (Poaceae) is a genetically and morphologically diverse warm-season grass widely used for pasture, forage, turf grass, soil stabilization, and remediation [7, 8]. Over the past decades, several studies have examined morphology, physiology, and biochemistry in order to assess the diversity of C. dactylon [9–12]. There is enormous morphological variability among the nine recognized Cynodon species [13]. Australia is third to Africa and Asia respectively in terms of Cynodon species diversity and seven Cynodon species currently were recognized in the Australian Biological Resources Study [14, 15]. Bermudagrass is widespread in Italy under different ecological situations, and there was wide variation in wild populations concerning morphological traits of potential interest for turf use, such as leaf size and growth habit [16].Geographical or environmental gradient exerts the strongest adaptive selection on some related variation both in genetic structure and phenotypic traits of a species. Many of these factors include temperature, precipitation, soil nutrient availability, growing season length, photoperiod and biotic agents are directly affected by geographic position or elevation, and are therefore interrelated. Such latitudinal gradients in species richness are among the most universal features of nature and have been discussed by many authors [17, 18]. Changes in latitude have a drastic effect on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil and hence change the quality of soil. Regeneration and growth of vegetation occurred successfully are affected by a variety of conditions of soil [19]. It is well known that N transformations are affected by a number of soil properties, including mineralogy and texture, organic matter quantity and quality, pH, moisture, and microbial population size [20], and these soil properties can vary considerably from one turfgrass system to another [21, 22]. Soil organic matter is an important component of soil, and microbial biomass is the living and active part of the soil organic matter, the source and sink of available nutrients, builds up with increased accumulation of organic matter during soil development [23–26] . Some types of reactive N (e.g., NH4+ and NO3-) are essential to plant growth and ecosystem productivity. Due to the direct relationship between soil nutrients and quality, it is closely linked to the primary productivity of the ecosystem [27], and responsible for the nutrient cycling and development and function of the soil system [28, 29]. Latitudinally-defined climate conditions may provide specific Cynodon types and soil environments. The optimal resolution at which soil and Cynodon variables should be sensed and treated is not well defined. Scientific information on the variability and distribution of soil properties is critical for understanding ecosystem processes and making sustain-able soil, crop, and environmental management decisions [30, 31]. Strategic sampling of Cynodon at simply different latitude has not been conducted in China and the collection is expected to include valuable germplasm for Cynodon improvement and research. The objectives of this study were: (1) to examine morphological variability of Cynodon along latitude gradient; (2) to determine if and how differences in morphological traits of Cynodon were correlated with climate factors and soil nutrient. This information will facilitate the future use of germplasm in Cynodon breeding, genomics, conservation, taxonomy, and phylogeographical research and evaluate accurately whether natural selection and migration may allow evolutionary responses for populations to sufficiently match their new climates.MethodsPlant materials and morphological evaluation\n                A total of 310 individual plants of C. dactylon, comprising of root and stem with a spacing of at least 50 m apart among each individual, were separately collected from 16 sites at different latitudes between 22°35'N and 36°18'N with similar longitude in China (Table 1). The morphological traits of each bermudagrass plants were examined on the collection site, including leaf length, leaf width, internode diameter, internode length, turf height, and reproductive branch height during August 2015. The longest leaf at the third node below the apical meristem of the stolon and erect shoot was used for the measurement of leaf length (mm) and leaf width (mm) with vernier calipers. Additionally, random stolons and erect shoots on each site were measured for internode length (mm) and diameter (mm) between the third and fourth fully extended nodes from the apical meristem. Turf height (mm) and reproductive branch height (mm) were determined quantitatively on each site. Total annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, annual maximum and minimum temperature of each collection location were provided by the China Meteorological Administration (Table 1).Table 1\n                        C. dactylon populations collected from different latitudes in China\n                      Population codeLocalitiesAltitude/mLatitudeLongitudeAnnual average temperature/°CAnnual maximum temperature/°CAnnual minimum temperature/°CAnnual average precipitation/mm1Cixian13036°18'40<U+2033>114°11'51<U+2033>13.419.57.9509.22Huixian12035°29'26<U+2033>113°48'23<U+2033>14.620.39.8586.93Zhengzhou9034°54'04<U+2033>113°38'20<U+2033>14.720.39.9640.84Xuchang9034°00'30<U+2033>113°45'23<U+2033>14.620.39.9733.55Zhumadian5033°09'47<U+2033>114°03'45<U+2033>15.220.410.7990.46Xinyang10032°08'38<U+2033>113°59'46<U+2033>15.520.411.71106.17Xiaochang5031°18'59<U+2033>114°02'15<U+2033>16.821.313.41138.08Xiantao3030°25'48<U+2033>113°26'05<U+2033>17.021.213.81238.69Linxiang6029°28'32<U+2033>113°26'48<U+2033>16.821.513.41582.510Liuyang9028°09'14<U+2033>113°33'42<U+2033>17.522.513.81551.311Youxian9027°00'59<U+2033>113°23'07<U+2033>18.122.614.81518.412Guidong81026°03'49<U+2033>113°56'34<U+2033>15.821.612.11742.413Renhua9025°05'29<U+2033>113°43'17<U+2033>19.925.116.51660.914Yingde5024°10'31<U+2033>113°22'08<U+2033>21.225.818.11835.915Guangzhou1022°51'48<U+2033>113°22'22<U+2033>22.827.219.61906.816Zhongshan022°35'40<U+2033>113°23'17<U+2033>22.025.919.11846.8\n              Soil nutrients evaluation\n                Soil samples (0–20 cm depth) were collected separately under the canopy of the different plant of C. dactylon in twenty random quadrats (10 m<U+2009>×<U+2009>10 m) at each site in August 2015. In each quadrat, the soil was randomly collected with five replicates. After carefully removing the surface organic materials and fine roots, the soil sample was air-dried at 25 °C room temperature for the estimation of soil physicochemical properties, exclusive of plant residues and ground to pass through 2 mm nylon sieves for analyzing Available Nitrogen(AN), Soil Organic Matter (SOM), Total Nitrogen (TN), pH, exchangeable Ca, Na, Mg and Available Kalium(AK). Chemical analyses were conducted following the methodologies [32]. The AN, SOM, TN and AK were measured using the Kjeldahl method, the potassium dichromate wet combustion procedure (Agricultural Chemistry Committee of China, 2006), Kjeldahl method (Agricultural Chemistry Committee of China, 1987) and flame emission spectrometry (Agricultural Chemistry Committee of China, 2004), respectively. Soil pH was measured with a glass electrode, samples having been diluted with water (the ratio of soil to water was 1:2.5). Exchangeable Ca, Mg and Na concentrations were determined on continuum-source atomic-absorption spectrometry (SpectrAA20 Varian) with soil extracts.\n              Statistical analysis\n                One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures were used to test significant differences in soil properties, morphological characters of C. dactylon among latitudinal gradients. We also used morphological data to calculate Shannon-Wiener index by using software package Popgen 32 to evaluate the variation frequency and degree of variation of morphological traits of different geographical groups. The geographical distance matrix was calculated by using the arc distance between each pair of sites based on the latitude and longitude of locations. Mantel correlation coefficients between morphological traits and geographical distance matrices were calculated by using NTSYSpc version 2.10e. For each morphological variable the observe values in different latitude were subjected to a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) using Ward’s method. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to check the relationships between morphological traits and environmental characters. Statistical analysis was performed using the software package SPSS13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA). Figures were generated by Sigmaplot 10.0 (Systat Software Inc.) and the R package.\n              ResultsANOVA analysis\n                Descriptive statistics including mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV) for C. dactylon morphological data were given in Table 2. Analysis of data showed high morphological variability at different latitude. With regard to morphological traits, the CV values of leaf length, internodes length, turf height and reproductive branch height were relatively high. The CV analysis indicated that leaf length of stolon was the most variable morphological trait with a CV of 44.88% (Table 2). The leaf width and diameter were not significantly differentiated, with a CV equal approximately to 10%. Also, Cynodon morphological diversity has been partly determined by calculating different morphological traits Shannon-Wiener index. During Cynodon morphological traits, range of Shannon-Wiener index within latitude was 1.53–1.87, while range of Shannon-Wiener index among latitude was 1.91–2.16 (Table 3). High values of Shannon-Wiener index of different morphological traits showed high morphological traits diversity. Different Shannon-Wiener index along latitude gradient indicates different degree of morphological diversity. Morphological traits were significantly different along the latitudinal gradient by ANOVA analysis, suggesting a notable effect of latitude on the morphological traits (Table 4). Significant variation was also found among different soil properties (Table 5), SOM showed the greatest variability with a CV of 79.59%. In contrast, pH exhibited the lowest variability with a CV of 7.24%.Table 2\n                        Morphological features of the bermudagrass ecotypes used in the diversity analysis\n                       ParameterMinimum(mm)Maximum(mm)Mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>SDCV(%)Erect shootLeaf length23.7269.8241.34 ± 12.9131.24Leaf width2.082.772.40 ± 0.218.80Internode length11.2436.0420.49 ± 7.1334.80diameter0.731.040.86 ± 0.0910.73StolonLeaf length18.9984.9239.32 ± 17.6544.88Leaf width2.243.032.55 ± 0.259.68Internode length22.2455.3938.97 ± 10.0425.76diameter0.911.181.02 ± 0.098.45 Turf height76.30269.40129.80 ± 47.7036.74 Reproductive branch height69.00240.00142.50 ± 48.8034.21Table 3\n                        The Compare of diversity index in Morphological characters\n                      Population codeErect shootStolonTurf heightReproductive branch heightLeaf lengthLeaf widthInternode lengthDiameterLeaf lengthLeaf widthInternode lengthDiameter11.27991.22061.64341.83441.50481.60941.27991.69571.50481.695721.71271.80821.82172.03311.85141.78201.63852.05581.58331.808231.49561.69081.52751.77371.67881.37281.76511.94341.47080.981941.62301.86051.61231.77711.61031.62301.76511.81740.91431.721951.86051.83441.84791.70361.80471.96041.69571.75102.01621.679661.84792.05581.85142.01621.58422.06851.87751.94341.60032.055871.27731.92981.32741.87751.24881.58331.67822.06851.49561.501381.82171.75241.59541.98310.94331.54301.44061.89451.73891.669691.22061.52181.33081.67881.54301.75241.32851.63651.16111.2376101.80821.89451.54301.67881.49991.87411.90021.91721.61731.8183111.50991.81831.84441.84791.30471.95601.54102.05581.33081.6400121.87261.80821.91722.06851.73401.98651.96951.53531.83441.9865131.75241.60461.78201.99921.48781.99001.87412.08551.76931.6526141.94341.82171.83091.79121.59111.84441.70581.66041.84651.8775151.94341.70361.94341.91581.52601.98651.97301.37281.48781.7524161.58331.59111.88671.94341.55371.73402.05582.01271.59111.4703Mean1.65951.74481.70661.87011.52921.79161.71801.84041.56021.6593Total2.03382.09222.06682.13021.91162.16262.07132.08322.04742.0650Table 4\n                        Morphological traits of the bermudagrass for each site along a latitudinal gradient used in analysis of variance (ANOVA)\n                      TraitsSource of variationSum of squaresdfFP-ValueLeaf length of erect shootsAmong sites49,676.968157.6690.000Within sites126,959.6294  Total176,636.568309  Leaf width of erect shootsAmong sites13.256154.0980.000Within sites63.401294  Total76.657309  Internode length of erect shootsAmong sites15,168.084158.7110.000Within sites34,129.559294  Total49,297.644309  Diameter of erect shootsAmong sites2.523154.5560.000Within sites10.852294  Total13.375309  Leaf length of stolonAmong sites92,917.8159.5620.000Within sites190,451.495294  Total283,369.295309  Leaf width of stolonAmong sites18.252155.4620.000Within sites65.496294  Total83.748309  Internode length of stolonAmong sites30,016.446154.80.000Within sites122,555.695294  Total152,572.141309  Diameter of stolonAmong sites2.209152.7950.000Within sites15.491294  Total17.7309  Turf heightAmong sites6810.651514.5380.000Within sites9182.288294  Total15,992.938309  Reproductive branch heightAmong sites6688.8481510.9750.000Within sites11,945.886294  Total18,634.735309  \n                      Significant at 1% level P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01\n                    Table 5\n                        Soil features of different latitudes used in the diversity analysis\n                      ParameterNMinimum(g/kg)Maximum(g/kg)Mean<U+2009>±<U+2009>SDCV(%)Total Nitrogen160.451.881.14 ± 0.3732.27%Available Kalium160.110.350.20 ± 0.0841.41%Available Nitrogen160.010.160.06 ± 0.0353.86%Soil Organic Matter1611.55105.5028.24 ± 22.4879.59%Exchangeable Ca161.918.453.80 ± 1.9150.29%Exchangeable Mg160.080.380.21 ± 0.1150.92%Exchangeable Na160.060.330.14 ± 0.0750.96%pH165.727.166.58 ± 0.487.24%\n              Cluster analysis\n                PCA allowed us to find out which variables contribute most to the differences among groups (Table 6). The first two principal components (PCs) accounted for 67.47% of total variance. Dendrograms was used to graphically represent a hierarchical cluster analysis of the relationship between 16 populations based on bermudagrass morphological traits at different latitudes, respectively. From the cluster analyses, obvious effect of latitude on the morphological traits of common bermudagrass was observed. In dendrogram generated based on bermudagrass morphological traits, the 16 populations were separated into 4 clusters on the unweighted pair group mean average (UPGMA) tree (Fig. 1). This dendrogram showed that cluster A corresponded with middle latitude, cluster B corresponded with low latitude, cluster D corresponded with high latitude, while cluster C was the admixture group with low and high latitude. We attempted to estimate whether morphological traits and soil properties varied with latitudinal gradient. Based on the results, the distribution of morphological traits and soil properties within the 16 populations among the different latitudes was presented in Table 7. These four clusters were different mainly in morphological traits, with lower values in cluster A than in clusters B, C and D.Table 6\n                        Loadings of the significant morphological variables on two first principal components from analysis of C. dactylon morphological data\n                       VariablePrincipal component12Erect shootLeaf length0.156-0.218Leaf width0.1570.195Internode length0.172-0.096diameter0.1140.302StolonLeaf length0.126-0.257Leaf width0.1580.083Internode length0.1350.195Diameter0.1240.315 Turf height0.148-0.186 Reproductive branch height0.171-0.192\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Dendrogram generated by Ward’s method of cluster analysis showing four major clusters on the basis of morphological characters of C. dactylon populations in China.

Most of the measured morphological traits at different latitude showed some kind of correlations with climate factors (Table 8). Annual average precipitation negatively correlated (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) with leaf length, diameter, turf height, reproductive branch height, internodes length of erect shoots and leaf width of stolon. As for annual average temperature, it significantly correlated with diameter, turf height, leaf length of stolon, and leaf width of stolon (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) and leaf length of erect shoots (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). Beyond that, annual minimum temperature negatively correlated with reproductive branch height and internodes length of erect shoots (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05). There were positive relationships between climate factors and Diversity index. The similar distribution patterns of morphological traits and soil properties indicated their high correlation. Correlation coefficients between morphological traits and soil properties are presented in Table 9. In general, contents of AK, AN and soil exchangeable Mg had significant effects on the bermudagrass morphological traits. The soil available kalium content was dramatically correlated with internodes length of erect shoots (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.708), leaf width of erect shoots (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.659) and reproductive branch height (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.763); and positively with leaf length of stolon (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.559) and erect shoots (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.567). AN was positively correlated with leaf length of erect shoots (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.544), leaf width of erect shoots (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.550) and reproductive branch height (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.587). Meanwhile, exchangeable Mg was positively correlated with distance between internodes of erect shoots (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.511), diameter of erect shoots (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.601) and stolon (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.622). Results indicate that bermudagrass morphological traits had a tendency to improve with the increase of soil exchangeable Mg, AN and available potassium content.Table 8\n                        Correlation coefficients between morphological traits of bermudagrass (C. dactylon) and meteorological characters\n                      TraitsErect shootStolonTurf heightReproductive branch heightDiversity indexLeaf lengthLeaf widthInternode lengthDiameterLeaf lengthLeaf widthInternode lengthDiameterAnnual average temperature-.120*-0.053-0.089-.181**-.193**-.160**-0.002-.181**-.199**-<U+2009>0.0610.253Annual maximum temperature-0.072-<U+2009>0.012-<U+2009>0.039-.152**-.140*-.114*0.034-.160**-.142*-<U+2009>0.0040.296Annual minimum temperature-.159**-0.081-.144*-.215**-.235**-.188**-<U+2009>0.039-.210**-.251**-.114*0.252Annual average precipitation-.221**-0.108-.235**-.270**-.298**-.186**-0.063-.237**-.344**-.210**0.308\n                      *, **: significant at probability of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively\n                    Table 9\n                        Correlation coefficients between morphological traits of bermudagrass (C. dactylon) and soil characters\n                      TraitsErect shootStolonTurf heightReproductive branch heightLeaf lengthLeaf widthInternode lengthDiameterLeaf lengthLeaf widthInternode lengthDiameterTotal Nitrogen0.1580.1620.084-0.0480.1470.336-0.262-<U+2009>0.1690.1940.130Available Kalium0.567*0.659**0.708**0.3710.559*0.4760.4970.2990.4970.763**Available Nitrogen0.544*0.550*0.4560.0840.4370.4960.170-0.0370.3380.587*Soil Organic Matter0.078-0.0500.090-0.180-0.097-<U+2009>0.017-0.174-<U+2009>0.1630.0850.040Exchangeable Ca0.2770.2140.4400.1480.0970.0960.1990.2050.3990.424Exchangeable Mg0.3850.2870.511*0.601*0.3510.2570.1530.622*0.4760.477Exchangeable Na0.207-0.0710.357-0.0370.073-<U+2009>0.0990.1690.0700.1980.253PH0.1700.2140.2150.0970.1850.2140.3260.0930.2470.194\n                      *, **: significant at probability of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively\n                    \n              DiscussionRelationship between morphological diversity and latitude\n                The measurements indicate a considerable morphological variation in bermudagrass populations along a latitudinal gradient. The morphological variability that exists within Cynodon spp. is well documented [13, 33]. The relationships between latitude and phenotypic variation (particularly phenology traits such as bud set) have been established previously in other species [34–38] and first published in Cynodon species. The presence of high morphological variation within regions and altitudes particularly above 2000 m a.s.l. indicated the potential of each region and high altitude zones for barley improvement and conservation in the country [39]. Our study has shown that morphological traits of Cynodon in the high- and low-latitude populations tended to have greater size than those from the mid-latitudes in China. Cynodon morphological variation along environmental gradients demonstrated that their geographic patterns were shaped by environmental factors (climatic and edaphic gradients) and phylogenetic differences. Such weather condition contributed positively to rice yield by increasing the number of panicles per hill and the number of spikelets per panicle significantly [40]. Through regulating the metabolic activity and carbon allocation of plants [41], climate directly influences the morphology of leaves. In addition, climate may influence the geographic distribution of leaf traits indirectly by shaping the biogeography of the vegetation as well as soil nutrient availability [42, 43]. The larger variance occurring within sites may be the result of micro-site variability, phylogenetic or historical effects, or biotic interactions and competition [44]. Polyploidization might be a driving force behind the divergence of Chinese Cynodon accessions and their biodiversity [45]. Adaptation in any species requires phenotypic variation in traits, but would not occur without genotypic variation. Within a species, this adaptation can theoretically be maintained through variable selection pressures from heterogeneous environments on a number of genes [46–49]. Genetic variation was expected based on previous reports of variation among C. dactylon accessions from geographic areas other than China [11, 33, 50–52].\n              Effect of soil nutrients on wild bermudagrass morphological diversity\n                Soil nutrients are important factors in evaluating soil quality, this approach, however, requires an understanding of the spatial variations of soil properties within fields. TN, available nitrogen and exchangeable Ca, Mg varied significantly among different latitudes and some soil nutrients were significantly correlated with Cynodon morphological characters, indicating that the phenotypic diversity presented in this species is possibly due to the variation in soil characters. Plants at high latitude need more nutrients to achieve fast growth as a response to selection imposed by lower temperatures and compressed growing seasons [53, 54]. In cold environments of high latitudes, sites can limit mineralization of organic matter, nutrient release from the mineral soil and biological nitrogen fixation. So more efficient nutrient resorption can be expected and resorbed nutrients are directly available for plant growth. It is postulated that in habitats with low nutrient availability, selection occurs for plant traits that result in higher nutrient conservation, including longer leaf and root life-span, higher sclerophylly and more efficient nutrient resorption from senescing organs [55, 56]. High level of organic matter supplied enough carbon, nitrogen and energy source to microbial growth. A close relationship has also been reported between soil fertility and microbial biomass [57, 58]. Internodes length of erect shoots, leaf width of erect shoots and reproductive branch height determined during the study have highly significant correlation (positive) with the soil available potassium. Exchangeable Mg and AN all were positively correlated with some morphological characters. Potassium (K), the third essential macro nutrient for higher plants, is involved in many important physiological processes in plants, and its functions have been shown to improve crop quality and the ability to resist adversities [59–61]. Plants from cold environments had significantly higher foliage N, P and Mg concentrations when grown in high latitudes, and that this may be an adaptive feature that enhances metabolic activity and growth rates under low temperatures of their native habitats [62, 63].\n              The evolution trend of bermudagrass morphological characteristics at different latitudes\n                According to the results of analysis, a significant relationship was observed between the latitude and a number of bermudagrass morphological characteristics, indicating that latitude was the key factor influencing the evolution of Cynodon. Soil and climate factors play notable roles in the shaping of Cynodon phenotype as two important factors related to latitude. Phenotypic plasticity could result from heritable epigenetic effects that influence gene expression at different developmental stages or in different environments. Populations may need to respond to environmental change through phenotypic plasticity or adaptive evolution, by moving to a new area corresponding to environmental conditions they are adapted to, by genetically adapting to the new conditions, or by combinations of these responses. The complex evolutionary and breeding history has undoubtedly created both population structure and complex familial relationships [64]. Characterizing its germplasms for morphological characteristics diversity is an essential step in selection and breeding of this grass. These morphological characteristics such as leaf length, leaf width, turf height and reproductive branch height play important roles in the application of turfgrass. Bermudagrass in low- and high-latitude areas posses longer blade, higher turf height and reproductive branch height, which can be used to protect slope on both sides of highway and prevent soil erosion. Cynodon of mid-latitudes with lower turf height and reproductive branch height is excellent germplasm resources for lawn in the stadium and park. Thus, there are rich bermudagrass germplasm resources in different environmental conditions. Selecting representative germplasm resources in a wide range of geographical location can screen out more excellent germplasm resources. Due to long-term growth of wild bermudagrass in the bad environment, it goes through many generations of natural selection, and keep down features of survival and reproduction, which provide a rich material for breeding and breed improvement. The grass family is one of the most diverse plant taxa, and turf grasses have long been subjected to systematic studies using morphological characters [65]. Information resulting from this study, therefore, could be applied to various studies on bermudagrass such as genomics, cytogenetics, genetics and breeding.\n              ConclusionsIn this study, these analyses against C. dactylon morphological traits and environment factors have revealed a remarkable variety of phenotypic resources at different latitudes which is important for the reserve and propagation of native Cynodon species. We also found that larger Cynodon morphological sizes were strongly associated with low- and high-latitudes among the 310 Cynodon accessions. For adaptive phenotypic plasticity to evolve, individuals must be capable of responding to latitude, and plastic genotypes must have a fitness advantage over genotypes that are incapable of altering their phenotypes. Our findings expand the current knowledge on morphological diversity of turf-type wild bermudagrass. Accessions of C. dactylon at different latitudes may further enrich the gene pool and adapt to more different environments, which are influenced by latitude-related soil characters such as soil available potassium, exchangeable Mg and available nitrogen and climate factors such as annual average precipitation and annual average temperature. The variation present in the Cynodon accessions may have significant contribution in C. dactylon breeding programs for various goals such as turf, forage, soil stabilization and remediation, as well as our understanding of the evolution of warm season grass.Abbreviations\n                AK: \n                    Available Kalium\n                  AN: \n                    Available Nitrogen\n                  ANOVA: \n                    One-way analysis of variance\n                  CA: \n                    Cluster Analysis\n                  CV: \n                    Coefficient of variation\n                  P: \n                    Probability\n                  PCA: \n                    Principal Component Analysis\n                  PCs: \n                    Principal components\n                  r: \n                    Correlation coefficients\n                  SD: \n                    Standard deviation\n                  SOM: \n                    Soil Organic Matter\n                  TN: \n                    Total Nitrogen\n                  UPGMA: \n                    Unweighted pair group mean average\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Hui-Ping Tian and Rui-Yang Wei for their help in sample collection.\n                Availability of data and materials\n                The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n              Authors’ contributionsJX analyzed and interpreted the patient data and was a major contributor in writing the manuscript.

Although microsatellite loci for the species have been identified from populations in southwestern China, amplification of those markers for Korean populations have been unsuccessful. The complicated taxonomy of Korean striped field mouse including populations on Jeju Island (A. a chejuensis) necessitates identification of additional molecular markers.\n              \n                Findings\n                We applied 454 pyrosequencing systems to develop a suite of microsatellite markers. Muscle tissue was harvested and sequenced from 30 Jeju striped field mouse specimens which yielded 12,165 reads with a mean length per read of 287 bp. From these reads, we identified 17 microsatellite loci for A. a. chejuensis and tested these new markers against samples of both A. a chejuensis and A. a coreae, the mainland taxon. All 17 loci were amplified successfully for both taxa. Of the total 17 loci, one locus failed to amplify for a population on Heuksan Island. The cross-species transferability was also tested with the allied taxon, A. peninsulae and confirmed successful for 12 loci.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                These newly developed markers will benefit studies of genetic structure, evolution, and resolving taxonomic problems of striped field mice and allied taxa in Korea.\n              Keywords\n                        Apodemus agrarius chejuensis, Microsatellites, South Korea, Jeju Island, PyrosequencingIntroductionWith 24 subspecies, the striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius (Pallas, 1771) is widely distributed throughout Eurasia [1]. Striped field mice are the most abundant mammal in Korea with an important place in the ecosystems as a primary prey item for predators and a vector of seed dispersal [2]. In Korea, four subspecies (A. a mantchuricus, A. a. chejuensis, A. a. pallenscens, and A. a. coreae) have been reported, but only A. a. chejuensis on Jeju Island has a definitive geographic barrier from the other subspecies [3]. Based on differences in morphology [4–7], physiology [8], and mitochondrial DNA [9–11], the taxonomic status of A. a. chejuensis has changed frequently in rank between species and subspecies. The striped field mouse is the first known vector of Hanta virus, which killed roughly 3000 United Nations soldiers per year during the Korean War, which has attracted great attention by epidemiologists [12]. Because hemorrhagic fever never occurred in Jeju Island, the island subspecies was used as a control for the isolation of Hanta virus [12].Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs, microsatellites) are one of the most common and efficient nuclear DNA markers for population genetics and phylogenetic studies of recently diverged taxa because they are multiallelic, highly polymorphic, abundant and show a codominant mode of inheritance [13, 14]. However, development of microsatellite markers has been costly, ineffective, and time consuming [15]. The application of next generation sequencing technology has greatly improved these challenges over the past few years [14].To address ongoing taxonomic debates, the status of A. a. chejuensis and its relationship to mainland species should be examined using both haplotypic (mitochondrial DNA markers) and genotypic molecular markers (nuclear DNA markers). Wu et al. [16] developed 14 loci of microsatellite from populations in southwestern China; however, only five of 14 loci were successfully amplified in Korean striped field mouse samples [3]. Thus, nearly two thirds of the microsatellite markers available for the species failed to amplify in the targeted Korean populations [3]. Given the low transferability of the existing markers, we hypothesized that a limited proportion of markers developed for A. a chejuensis will be applicable for the mainland taxon, A. a coreae assuming their taxonomic status is different. Therefore, we developed 17 microsatellite loci from A. a. chejuensis for future investigation of genetic properties of the striped field mouse and then tested cross transferability for the markers against A. a coreae samples from the mainland.Sample preparation and genotyping\n                We used muscle tissues of A. a. chejuensis collected on Jeju Island to develop microsatellites loci. We collected 15 individuals each at Yongdu-dong (YD), Jeju-si (N33°31'08.72<U+2033> E126°29'47.77<U+2033>) and 15 individuals at Beophwan-dong (BH), Seogwipo-si, Korea (N33°24'42.97<U+2033> E126°51'52.74<U+2033>). We captured mice in Sherman traps following guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists [17]. Specimens were deposited in the mammal collection at the National Institute of Biological Resources, Korea (NIBRMM0000105863).\n                Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The isolated DNA was visualized on 1% agarose gel and quantified in NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). We used a total amount of over 2 µg with concentration of 50 ng/µL or higher for 454 pyrosequencing library preparation. Library preparation, amplification, and sequencing were conducted at Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Briefly, after DNA quality control steps, isolated genomic DNAs were fragmented using restriction enzymes and tagged them with two multiplex identifiers. After amplification of DNA fragments, the prepared libraries were pooled and sequenced in 454 GS FLX platform (Roche).\n              Primer design and testing makers\n                Candidate loci for microsatellites were selected using QDD3 software [18]. A total of 335 primer pairs were obtained for candidate loci using PRIMER3 [19]. Each locus was then evaluated with PCR amplification performed with a total volume of 25 µl containing 1.0 µl of genomic DNA, 2.5 µl of 10× buffer (Takara), 0.7 µl of dNTP (2.5 mM each), 1.5 µl of MgCl2, 0.5 µl of primers each, and 0.3 U of Taq polymerase (Takara r-Taq, Takara). PCR conditions were follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s, annealing at 45–60 °C for 60 s, elongation at 72 °C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were selected and sequenced to confirm whether they contained microsatellite sequences.\n                A M13-tail (FAM: 5’-TTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTG-3', VIC: 5’-GGAAACAGCTATGACCA-3', PET: 5’-GCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3', NED: 5’-TAAAACGACGGCCAGTGC-3') was added to the 5' end of each forward primers while a pig tail (GTTTCTT) was added to the 5' end of each reverse primers. For multiplex PCR, we performed PCR amplifications in a total reaction volume of 16 µl containing 5 µl of 2× QIAGEN Multiplex PCR master mix (QIAGEN), 0.08 µl of M13-tailed forward primer, 0.8 µl of pig tailed reverse primer, 0.3 µl of templated DNA and 0.16 µl of each of fluorescence primer (FAM/VIC/PET/NED). Multiplex PCR cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min followed by denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing (14 cycles at 63 °C, 7 cycles at 58 °C, 20 cycles at 55 °C) for 90 s and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final elongation at 72 °C for 20 min.).\n              Genotyping and population analysis\n                We genotyped 30 Jeju striped field mice (A. a chejuensis) from two populations (YD and BH) with the newly designed microsatellites. The amplified fragments were separated in ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystem, Inc., Forster City, CA, USA) and GeneMapper software v3.7 (Applied Biosystems) was used for manual scoring.\n                To test for cross-species transferability, we amplified one congener (Agrarius peninsulae) and one subspecies (A. a. coreae) using the 17 developed markers with the same PCR conditions. Additionally, we added an A. agrarius sample collected from Heuksan Island in the cross-species transferability run because Jo et al. [3] suggested that the A. agrarius population in Heuksan Island might be a newly diverged subspecies from the mainland populations (A. a. coreae) in Korea.\n                The following genetic diversity parameters were calculated using ARLEQUIN 3.5 [20]: the number of alleles at each locus (A), observed heterozygosity (HO), expected heterozygosity (HE) and population divergence (FST) between the two populations (BH and YD). Polymorphic information contents (PIC) were also estimated in CENES software (http://www.ufv.br/dbg/genes/genes.htm; Cruz 2007). We tested whether significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) within each population across all amplified loci in ARLEQUIN 3.5. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between pairs of loci within each population was tested using GENEPOP 4.2.1 [21, 22]. All statistical significances of multiple comparisons were adjusted with sequential Bonferroni corrections [23]. We performed Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) to hierarchically partition the total genetic variance within and between the two populations in GENALEX v. 6.5 [24]. We also carried out principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on pairwise FST for all 30 individuals to examine clustering pattern among the individual genotypes in GENALEX v. 6.5 [24].\n              Results & discussionFour hundred and fifty-four pyrosequencing produced 12,165 reads with a mean length of 287 bp.

The AMOVA results revealed that in the two populations most of genetic variation (88%) was harbored within each population, whereas among population genetic variation was proportionally minor (12%; Fig. 1). Coupled with the small FST value, the AMOVA results suggest that YD and BH are not greatly diverged in part due to high gene flow between the two populations. However, the PCoA analysis showed spatial structure among the two populations. Overall, the genotypes from each population are affiliated with the population from which the genotypes were drawn (Fig. 2). The clustering pattern indicates that the 17 markers developed from our study have sufficient power to separate out the two local populations.\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      A pie chart summarizing AMOVA results.

All 17 loci were successfully amplified for A. a. coreae and 12 of 17 loci were successfully amplified for A. peninsulae (Table 3). Except for the AC53 locus, all microsatellite loci were successfully amplified for individuals collected on Heuksan Island. The cross-species amplification could be an indicator of genetic distance among species. The Jeju island subspecies, A. a chejuensis has often been regarded a distinct species in Korea [3]. In contrast, the classification of the population on Heuksan Island has been A. a. coreae (the same as the mainland populations) in most of the literature despite its high genetic divergence from mainland populations as revealed in a microsatellite analysis [3]. Our cross-species amplification tests suggested that the subspecies A. a chejuensis might be more closely related to the mainland populations of A. a. coreae than the populations on Heuksan Island. Intensive population level studies with these developed markers might elucidate the true phylogenetic relationships among these three taxa.Table 3\n                      Results of cross-species amplifications\n                    LociSpecies\n                            Apodemus agrarius coreae\n                          \n                            Apodemus peninsulae\n                          AC2 L++ACH7++ACW7++AC9S++ACAQ++ACWV+–ACAV+–ACU8++AC9 M++AC124++ACEC+–ACQT+–ACHZ++AC53++ACLI+–AC5S++ACPJ++\n                    Seven individual of each species were tested\n                    Note: + successful PCR amplification; - PCR failed\n                  Although this species is the main vector of Hanta virus and the most common mammal in the Korean Peninsula, few studies have addressed populations of the striped field mouse in Korea. One of the limitations in the study of A. agrarius is the deficiency of genetic markers [4]. The microsatellite loci developed in this study have proven to be useful for investigating genetic structure, introgression, hybrid, and taxonomic status of A. agrarius in not only the Korean Peninsula but the entire distribution for the species. The genetic markers might also be used to establish a management strategy for A. a. chejuensis, the most common endemic rodent on Jeju Island.Abbreviations\n                A: \n                    The number of allele at each locus\n                  BH: \n                    Beophwan-dong\n                  \n                    H\n                    E\n                  : \n                    Expected heterozygosity\n                  \n                    H\n                    O\n                  : \n                    Observed heterozygosity\n                  HWE: \n                    Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\n                  LD: \n                    Linkage disequilibrium\n                  PIC: \n                    Polymorphic information contents\n                  SSR: \n                    Simple Sequence Repeat\n                  YD: \n                    Yongdu-dong\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by a grant (NIBR201403201) from the National Institute of Biological Resources (NIBR), funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE), Republic of Korea.

The genome sequencing of these species allows for gene discovery with an eye towards discerning the natural variability available for future breeding. The Q-type C2H2 zinc-finger protein (ZFP) transcription factors contain zinc finger motifs with a conserved QALGGH as part of the motif and they may play a critical role in the plants response to stress. While they may contain from one to five ZF domains (ZFD) this work focuses on the ZFPs that contain two zinc-fingers, which bind to the promoter of genes, and negatively regulate transcription via the EAR motif. B. oleracea and rapa are diploid and evolved into distinct species about 3.7 million years ago. B. napus is polyploid and formed by fusion of the diploids about 7500 years ago.\n              \n                Results\n                This work identifies a total of 146 Q-type C2H2-ZFPs with 37 in B. oleracea, 35 in B. rapa and 74 in B. napus. The level of sequence similarity and arrangement of these genes on their chromosomes have mostly remained intact in B. napus, when compared to the chromosomes inherited from either B. rapa or oleracea. In contrast, the difference between the protein sequences of the orthologs of B. rapa and oleracea is greater and their organization on the chromosomes is much more divergent. In general, the 146 proteins are highly conserved especially within the known motifs. Differences within subgroups of ZFPs were identified. Considering that B. napus has twice the number of these proteins in its genome, RNA-Seq data was mined and the expression of 68 of the 74 genes was confirmed.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Alignment of these proteins gives a snapshot of the variability that may be available naturally in Brassica species. The aim is to study how different ZFPs bind different genes or how dissimilar EAR motifs alter the negative regulation of the genes bound to the ZFP. Results from such studies could be used to enhance tolerance in future Brassica breeding programs.\n              KeywordsBrassicaQ-type C2H2 zinc finger transcription factorsCabbageCanolaBackgroundQ-type C2H2 zinc finger proteins (ZFP) are transcription factors. “Q-type” refers to the invariant QALGGH sequence found in the zinc finger domains, and C2H2 characterizes the two cysteine and two histidine residues found in each finger. These residues bind a zinc ion that stabilizes the ZFP and allows binding specificity to a domain within the promoter of the gene it regulates. First discovered in petunia by Takatsuji et al. [1], a total of 21 Q-type C2H2 ZFPs have been described in that species [2]. Using in silico methods, Englbrecht et al. [3] described 3 groups of ZFPs in Arabidopsis; A, B and C, with the C family divided into three additional groups (C1, C2 and C3) depending on the number of spaces between the invariant histidines. There are 64 members in the C1 family that contain either a single or a cluster of two to five zinc finger domains (ZFDs). The C1 family has three amino acids between the histidines and contains many proteins responsive to environmental stress [4, 5]. In Arabidopsis, the 18 two fingered Q-type C2H2 ZFP proteins are members of the C1-2i and here will be referred to as ZFPs. The Arabidopsis proteins cluster into five groups named 2i-A-D with an outlier-X [3]. These ZFPs include a conserved domain containing the amino acids DLN. It is similar to the first active repression motif described in plants [6], which was named the ethylene-responsive element-binding factor (ERF)-associated amphiphilic repression (or EAR) domain. A role for the EAR motif as an active repressor was also demonstrated in ZFPs of Arabidopsis [7]. Ectopic expression of ZFPs can lead to an increase in tolerance to specific stresses [5]. Subsequently additional studies identifying all forms of C2H2 ZFPs have been undertaken in for example rice, foxtail millet, poplar and crocus [8–11]. Several other studies focused specifically on the Q-type C2H2 TFs, for example in poplar, or bread wheat [12, 13]. Generally, these studies utilize the availability of a published genome sequence, however, studies in bread wheat (a hexaploid organism) and crocus relied on ESTs from public databases [11, 13]. The work described in this manuscript, catalogs the Q-type ZFPs in three Brassica species. Therefore, naturally occurring variants within these proteins can be utilized in subsequent studies to identify how the altered sequences could affect gene expression. ZFPs might be useful as tools for breeding increased tolerance to biotic or abiotic stresses encountered by cole crops.In the current study, we identify ZFPs of economically important Brassica species, and analyze their structure and their expression using RNA-Seq data from previously published work. To cast a wide net for capturing genetically related ZFPs, three related species were examined and compared to Arabidopsis ZFPs. Arabidopsis is also a member of the Brassicaceae and evolved from the same ancestral progenitor as the Brassica species. The Arabidopsis lineage split from this ancestral progenitor approximately 20 million years ago (mya) with a whole genome duplication occurring in the Brassica lineage ~<U+2009>16 mya, which is reflected in a doubling in gene number when comparing Brassica to Arabidopsis [14]. Comparative mapping of Arabidopsis to several other similar species provides evidence for an ancestral Arabidopsis genome that has been divided into 24 blocks [15]. These have been reshuffled in present day Arabidopsis and these syntenic blocks have also been identified in modern Brassica species. Maps showing the reorganization of these blocks in B. rapa and B. oleracea have been published along with the genome sequences of these species [16, 17]. The blocks are not collinear in B. oleracea and B. rapa but have a different organizational pattern, probably due to chromosomal translocations during the time since these species split from their shared ancestor, about 3.7 mya [14]. These species are diploid, containing 9 and 10 chromosomes, respectively. Their genomes fused and duplicated to form B. napus ~<U+2009>7500 years ago [18]. Brassica species therefore are both diploid and polyploid. The triangle of U [19] represents their evolution with the diploid species B. rapa, nigra and oleracea at the points of the triangle containing genomes A, B and C respectively. Between the tips of the triangle are the polyploid species with B. napus along the side of the triangle between B. rapa and B. oleracea containing both A and C genomes, respectively. Since B. rapa contains 10 chromosomes and B. oleracea contains 9 chromosomes the B. napus genome still maintains 19 chromosomes. Indeed, the 19 B. napus chromosomes are labeled chromosome A1-A10 and C01-C09, reflecting the genomes from which they were derived. These species include many important oil and vegetable crops; such as broccoli, cabbage, Chinese cabbage and canola. Given the evolution of these crops, the comparison of the Q-type ZFPs in the three reference genomes should provide a picture of the genetic diversity available for testing the effects of different ZFPs on the biotic stress response in these species. Since this group of Q-type ZFPs have previously been associated with regulating environmental stress and can enhance tolerance to the stress [5], identification of these proteins in the commercially important Brassica species may lead to their use in breeding programs. This work identified 146 ZFPs in three Brassica species. Prior studies analyzing the ZFDs and EAR motifs mutated one protein at a time and demonstrated how this altered either DNA binding for the ZFDs or negative regulation with the modified EAR motif [2, 4, 5]. The study documented here begins to address how much variation in these motifs can occur naturally.MethodsProteins with sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis Q-type two-fingered C2H2 TF, Zat11 were identified using BLASTX in Bolbase (http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/), a database accessing the annotated Brassica oleracea genome [20]. Proteins from B. oleracea containing two Q-type C2H2 zinc finger motifs were selected and their best Arabidopsis match was found using BLASTP in the Arabidopsis genome database TAIR (https://www.arabidopsis.org/Blast/index.jsp). Ensembl Plants was also used for identification of additional B. oleracea genes and genes within the B. rapa genomes http://plants.ensembl.org/index.html. Finally, Genescope was used to identify B. napus genes http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/brassicanapus/. Subsequently Ensembl Plants was also used for updating genes from B. napus.For the phylogenetic analysis, proteins were aligned using CLUSTAL W and the phylogenetic tree was inferred using the Maximum likelihood method and the JTT matrix based model [21]. 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed [22]. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [23]. Alignment of Q-type ZFPs was performed using CLUSTAL OMEGA from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ Tools/msa/clustalo/. The proteins were analyzed using the program MEME (Multiple motifs for EM Elicitation) at (http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme) to identify conserved motifs. Nuclear localization domains were located using NLSMapper http://nls-mapper.iab.keio.ac.jp/cgi-bin/NLS_Mapper_form.cgi.The NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) SRA (Sequence Read Archive) was examined https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra for transcriptome studies of B. oleracea and B. napus to identify transcribed ZFPs. Ensembl Plants https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html and Genescope http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/brassicanapus/ were also used to catalog the location of ZFP genes on the genome.Results and discussionIdentification and phylogenetic analysis of Brassica genes\n                The B. rapa, oleracea and napus genomes [16–18] were searched by BLASTX using the Arabidopsis ZFP, Zat11 and 146 unique genes were identified. Initially a search of Bolbase [20] identified 25 unique B. oleracea Q-type C2H2 TFs [24]. A subsequent examination of the B. oleracea genome from Ensembl Plants (https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html) led to identification of 12 more ZFP genes (see Additional file 1). All 146 ZFP genes mined in this study were renamed based on their species designation (Bo, Br, BnaA or BnaC) followed by a ZFP and numbered based on their positions on the chromosome map. For example, the ZFP named BrZFP1 is found at the top of chromosome A1 in the B. rapa genome. The original gene name and location on the genome is listed (see Additional file 1). Several protein sequences were modified from the original genome annotation, based on comparison with the other closest homologs. These comparisons revealed that several of the originally annotated B. napus gene sequences included an intron that interrupted the conceptual translation and resulted in loss of protein sequence present in either the B. oleracea or the B rapa orthologs. The intron sequences were added back to these transcripts and re-translated, which resulted in proteins highly identical to those predicted from the diploid genomes of B. oleracea and B. rapa. A dataset has been published examining the Brassica napus transcriptome [25], in which our protein sequences were confirmed in the A (B. rapa) derived genome. The altered genes were given the prefix My and the protein sequences are shown (see Additional file 1) and are also aligned (see Additional file 2) to pinpoint the genes altered from the databases.\n                A phylogenetic map containing the 18 Arabidopsis proteins and 146 proteins from the three Brassica species (see Additional file 3) was generated using CLUSTALW and maximum likelihood analysis in MEGA6 software [23]. The Brassica proteins mapped into 5 groups clustering with the Arabidopsis proteins, which will also be referred to as groups 2i-A-D and X (Fig. 1). Alignments of the protein sequences using CLUSTAL OMEGA without Arabidopsis sequences confirmed the 5-subgroups (2i-A-D and X) found for the Arabidopsis proteins (see Additional file 2).\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Skeletonized phylogenetic tree of Brassica and Arabidopsis (Zats) Q-type ZFPs form 5 groups. The tree shows the position of the 18 Zats and the major bootstrap values. Groups are delineated as 2i-B, 2i-A, 2i-C, 2i-D and 2i-X in pink blue, green, yellow and turquoise, respectively. The proteins were aligned with CLUSTALW and the phylogenetic tree was generated using the maximum likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. A complete tree with the names of all Brassica and Arabidopsis proteins are in (Additional file 3)\n                      \n              Comparative mapping of Brassica ZFPs\n                A map of the chromosomes comparing the position of ZFP genes from B. oleracea, rapa to napus is shown (Fig. 2). Most ZFP genes map not only to the same chromosome between the species, but to a similar location within the chromosome. The orthologs also generally contain 97–100% identity in protein sequence. Brassica rapa contains 35 ZFPs, while the A genome (derived from B. rapa) of B. napus contains 38 ZFPs. Once again a comparison of the A genome (B. rapa derived) of B. napus (A01-A10) with that of B. rapa (A1-A10) shows the co-linearity between the ZFP genes along the same chromosome and within the same general location on the chromosome. The orthologs between these two species of the A genome also show between 97 and 100% identity in their protein sequences. Comparison of the C genome (B. oleracea derived) chromosomes of B. napus (C01-C09) with B. oleracea (C1-C9) shows that there are 37 ZFPs in the B. oleracea genome and 36 ZFPs in the B. napus C genome. Two B. oleracea, 5 BnaC and 3 BnaA ZFP genes remain to be mapped onto chromosomes (see Additional file 1). However mapped ZFPs show the same strong percent identity to their unmapped orthologs. For example, BoZFP20 and BnaCZFP32 protein sequences are 100% identical, but the B. napus gene is currently unmapped.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Comparison of ZFP proteins on diploid Brassica species and the polyploid Brassica napus. Chromosomes of Brassica rapa in dark gray (BrZFP) Brassica oleracea in dark blue (BoZFP) to Brassica napus with the A genome in light gray (BnaAZFP) and C genome in light blue (BnaCZFP). BnaAZFP36, 37 and 38 are unmapped. Within the 35 BnaAZFP mapped genes, 83% (29) map to similar positions as BrZFP genes. Of the 38 BnaAZFP proteins 84% (32) have 97–100% (red) identity and 3 have 93–96% (purple). The final 3 proteins (black) have 81% (BnaAZFP9), 56% (BnaAZFP21) and 85% (BnaAZFP34) identity to the Br homolog. Generally, the BoZFP and the BnaCZFP genes map to the same location on the chromosome with either 96–100% (red) or 93–95% (purple) identity. BoZFP20 and BoZFP32 have homologous proteins that are currently unmapped in the B. napus genome (BnaCZFP32 and BnaCZFP33), while BoZFP4 and BoZFP8 (black) have no homolog in the B. napus genome. BoZFP36 and BoZFP37 (black) are currently unmapped on the B. oleracea genome and they are homologous to BnaCZFP34 and BnaCZFP35, which are also unmapped. BoZFP7 (black) is a homolog and maps to a B. napus gene that contains only a portion of the ORF\n                      \n                Comparisons of the map positions and protein sequence identities between ZFP genes of the diploid species, B. rapa and B. oleracea (Fig. 3) show more divergence in comparison to B. napus, as would be expected from species that appeared so much earlier than the formation of B. napus. Only 13 ZFP genes map to the same location and their gene products exhibit 92–98% protein sequence identity. Three genes in B. oleracea from chromosome 9 map to a similar location on chromosome 10 of B. rapa. This supports similar findings that the A and C genomes of B. oleracea and B. rapa have had more opportunity to diverge from one another than they have from the B. napus genome.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Comparison of map position and percent identity between the diploid Brassicas. Brassica rapa (top) and Brassica oleracea (bottom) chromosomes with red gene names containing protein sequences that are 92–98% identical, map to the same chromosome and are in identical order. BrZFP10 and BrZFP11 are tandem duplications. Genes in black are not present in the other species (BoZFP23, BoZFP29, BoZFP36). BrZFP14 is a homolog of BoZFP1, which is currently unmapped. Additional homologous pairs between the two species are identified by like colors and with or without underline or italics. These additional genes generally do not appear in the same genomic location. An exception is the 3 genes in orange on either chr 9 of B. oleracea or chr 10 of B. rapa\n                      \n              Evolution of Arabidopsis and Brassica ZFPs\n                The number of orthologs of the eighteen Arabidopsis ZFPs in the Brassica oleracea, rapa and A and C genome of B. napus is shown in Tables 1 and 2. There are generally 2 or 3 homologs of most Arabidopsis ZFPs represented in the B. oleracea and B. rapa genomes, which is consistent with the genome duplication event that took place in the Brassica progenitor at about 16 mya after the split from Arabidopsis. While Zat12 has four homologs in B. rapa, one of these is a tandem duplication and probably arose after the evolution of B. napus. Only two of the Arabidopsis genes (Zat6 and AZF3) have a single homolog in B. oleracea or B. rapa, and there are no homologs in the Brassica genomes for Zat7 and Zat8. However, these are tandem duplications in the Arabidopsis genome of Zat16, suggesting that they may have arisen after the split of Arabidopsis from the Brassica species. Zat16 does have two homologs in both B. oleracea and B. rapa.Table 1\n                        Number of Arabidopsis ZFP homologs in the Brassica A and C genome\n                      Gene NameArabidopsis Gene ID# of Bo homologs# of Br homologs# of BnaA homologs# of BnaC homologs2i-XAt1g020403213Zat10 (2i-D)At1g277303223ZAT5 (2i-C)At2g282002222ZAT17 (2i-B)At2g287102222ZAT11 (2i-A)At2g374302233ZAT15 (2i-C)At3g104702221AZF2 (2i-D)At3g195803333ZAT16 (2i-B)At3g460702232ZAT8 (2i-B)At3g460800000ZAT7 (2i-B)At3g460900000ZAT13 (2i-D)At3g499302223ZAT18 (2i-A)At3g536002222ZAT14 (2i-C)At5g035103343ZAT6 (2i-D)At5g043401011(2i-C)At5g043903332AZF3 (2i-D)At5g431701111ZAT12 (2i-B)At5g598203442AZF1 (2i-D)At5g674503333Table 2\n                        Homologs of ZFPs from Arabidopsis and Brassica A and C genome\n                      \n                      \n                    \n                      *members of tandem duplications in square boxes\n                    \n                Generally, when two genomes combine and double their chromosomes, genes are lost over evolutionary time to compensate for the massive increase in genes. However, B. napus is a relatively new polyploid (forming ~<U+2009>7500 years ago) and may not have completely achieved this balance. The number of Q-type-ZFPs found in B. napus is 74, which is slightly more than double the amount in the diploid species. There have also been tandem duplications of genes in B. rapa and both the BnaA and BnaC genomes, which are not present in the other genomes, suggesting that they occurred after splitting (in the case of the diploids) or merging in the case of the tetraploid (Table 2). There were tandem duplications in the BnaA genome for Zat12 and Zat16 and Zat11. In B. napus there are a total of 3 Zat15 homologs and all three are 100% identical to their B. oleracea and B rapa homologs. Since the diploid genomes have two Zat15 homologs each, the B. napus genome has lost one (Table 2).\n              Conserved protein motifs and zinc finger spacing in Brassica ZFPs\n                To understand the variation in conserved protein motifs in the Brassica ZFPs, the MEME Suite (http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme) was used to identify common motifs in all 146 Brassica ZFPs and separately in each subgroup (2i-A-D and X). There are four conserved motifs in the Q-type two fingered ZFPs (Fig. 4). The first motif is the L-box, a leucine rich domain near the amino terminal end of the protein. The two zinc fingers are also conserved, with an invariant QALGGH in both zinc finger motifs and unique characteristics within these two motifs. The EAR motif was also examined for each group of Brassica ZFPs. A composite motif for each of the two zinc fingers, the L-box and EAR motif is presented (Fig. 4). Variations and similarities in amino acids within the motifs for each subgroup (2iA-D and X) are also shown (Fig. 4). The first zinc finger motif contains the following invariant amino acid sequence ‘CXXCXXXFXSXQALGGHXXXH’ with X being a placeholder representing variable residues within the protein sequence. The 2i-A and B groups have a KT between the two invariant Cs, and an F between the invariant S and Q. Finally, the first zinc finger motif of the 2i-A group ends with RAXHKKPKL while the 2i-B group ends with RASHXXXX. The 2i-C group starts with CXTC and has an F between the invariant S and QALGGH and ends with RXSHKKXX. The 2i-D subgroup starts with CXVC and ends with SYQALGGHKXSHRXXX. Finally, the 2i-X group starts with CKXC and ends with SHQALGGHRXSHKKVK. All the subgroups have an R after the QALGGH except for the 2i-D group. Similar specific intra-motif sequences can be observed in the second zinc finger motif (Fig. 4).\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Conserved motifs identified in 146 Brassica ZFP proteins and in all five separate ZFP groups. A cartoon (top) shows the position of the conserved motifs on the protein sequence. Consensus motifs common to all 146 Q-type ZFPs from Brassica oleracea, rapa and napus include, 2 zinc finger motifs with invariant QALGGH (center) and an L-box (left) and EAR-motif (right). Amino acids in bold black are invariant within the composite motifs. Red and green amino acids are common to more than one of the subgroups within either the first or second zinc finger motifs. Alignment of all Brassica proteins in each subgroup confirms the presence of the motif variations (see Additional file 2)\n                      \n                The spacing of the fingers is believed to be important to the DNA motifs they bind, and unlike ZFPs found in other organisms, is variable in plants [26]. For example, the 2iA group had ~<U+2009>19 amino acids between zinc fingers, 2i-B between 21 and 26, 2i-C 39–52, 2i-D 33–44 and 2i-X 39–43 amino acids between the zinc fingers (see Additional file 2). The 2i-X proteins all contained a string of “E”s in the spacer region between zinc fingers (see Additional file 2).\n                Nuclear localization sequences (NLS) were also predicted in the 146 ZFPs using NLSMapper http://nls-mapper.iab.keio.ac.jp/cgi-bin/NLS_Mapper_form.cgi (see Additional file 2). The NLS motifs were identified in different positions in the different groups of ZFPs. The 2i-A proteins had the NLS motif within the first zinc finger, 2i-B did not contain a NLS domain as defined by NLS mapper, 2i-C and 2i-D contained a NLS N terminal of the L box and 2i-X contained an NLS at the end of the zinc finger spacer (see Additional file 2).\n                The L-box is far less conserved, but contains 3–4 negatively charged amino acids D or E followed by amino acids with nonpolar neutral side chains such as ACLMI (hence the name L-box) as well as polar neutral side chains such as NST. The subgroups follow this general pattern, but there is little consensus within the groups (Fig. 4). Generally, the composite EAR motif contains DLNL. The 2i-A and 2i-C groups both contain the sequence LDLNL with a TP at the end for 2i-A and PA at the end for 2i-C. The 2i-B group has little consensus with variants at each amino acid. The 2i-D group contains DLN but none of the other amino acids are invariant. The 2i-X group contains LDLXLXC. Kagale and Rozwadowski [27] examined EAR motifs in plant species and defined LxLxL and DLNxxP as the most common types. The Brassica species in 2i-A and C match the LxLxL group while the 2i-D group conform to the DLN type EAR motif, but only a subgroup contains DLNxxP (see Additional file 2).\n                A manuscript published in 2015 outlines the Q-type ZFPs in Brassica oleracea [24] using the Bolbase genome, which was the only genome available at the time http://www.ocri-genomics.org/bolbase/ [20]. Only 25 Q-type ZFPs were identified and the protein sequences fell into two groups G1 and G2. About the same time, another manuscript was published by Parkin et al. [28] analyzing the transcriptome and methylome of B. oleracea and the data made available to Ensembl Plants (https://plants.ensembl.org/Brassica_oleracea/Info/Annotation/). Using this additional dataset 12 extra ZFPs were identified and used in this analysis of Brassica ZFPs. The G1 group contains mostly 2i-C type ZFPs with only one 2i-B and one 2i-A. The G2 group contains only 2i-D ZFPs. Therefore, the G1 group is biased towards 2i-C motifs. Therefore the additional dataset enhances the number of 2i-A and 2i-B type BoZFPs.\n              Expression of Brassica oleracea and napus transcripts\n                The NCBI SRA (sequence read archive) database, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra, was queried to confirm that the B. oleracea genes were indeed transcribed (Table 3). Examination of four BioProjects using either B. oleracea var. capitata or italica containing a total of 22 different samples provide evidence that transcript for 35 of 37 Q-type C2H2 ZFPs were present in at least one tissue type. Only BoZFP1 and BoZFP15 transcription could not be verified. Considering that these genes are often induced by stress, perhaps there is no experiment in the NCBI SRA database yet that uses the appropriate conditions to induce their expression.Table 3\n                        B. oleracea Q-type C2H2 TF transcript length and expression\n                      BoZFPEnsemblaBolbaseaTranscription Notesb,cBoZFP1  cannot find transcript info for this geneBoZFP2534 found EAR motif in club root SRR but there is a gap between 112-132BoZFP3 669locus_18655, bud SRR630928 1–643 100% ID, seedling 102043,7–637, SNPs at 207, 537 and 541BoZFP4 1170bud and flower, missing 1–47 in bud with gap at 793–815, or 1–168 in flower up to 1100BoZFP5 786locus_27313, 2–746 with gap at 273–277BoZFP6 807locus_29791 in seedling 102043, 5–775BoZFP7 1050bud missing 1–66 bases, SNP at 372BoZFP8474 102043 flower has most of the transcript seedling is missing L-boxBoZFP9 708locus_24740 and 40724, seedling 102043, 10 SNPs, 13–677BoZFP10 831locus_9351 stem also found in stem of 2, 1–824BoZFP11 1092flower with gap at 344–357BoZFP12477420flowerBoZFP13 807107140 leaf 100% ID, flower of 2 is 1–763 and bud is 7–772 with a gap 672–683BoZFP14 726locus_2060, seedling 107140, 1–718 SNP at 492, in 102043 find gap at ~<U+2009>450–550BoZFP15615 cannot find this transcriptBoZFP16 702seedling 102043, 2–670BoZFP17543 102043 seedlingBoZFP18453 102043 complete coverage of entire transcriptBoZFP19 882leaf of 107140 and flower of 2 covering 1–878BoZFP20864 102043 flower 2–841 includes the EAR motifBoZFP21447 102043 seedling 3–447 only 1 SNP foundBoZFP22540 102043 seedlingBoZFP23 717C1220 clubroot resistant, 1–717 with gap 327–352 and SNPs 173, 213, 471, 503, 653. 1–400 bases no gap or SNPs in 7 day cotyledon of broccoliBoZFP24792 bud of SRR630928BoZFP25 690seedling 102043, 14–684BoZFP26810801locus_47213, seedling 102043BoZFP271155936clubroot resistant 27–862, gap 604–639BoZFP28507 107140 seedlingBoZFP29 696seedling 102043BoZFP30 570flowerBoZFP31639468flower M?

Considering the similarity to the genes in the diploid genomes, expression of these genes in B. napus was determined using previously published RNA-Seq data (see Additional file 4). B. napus genes were divided into groups based on the similarity to the18 Arabidopsis two fingered ZFPs. Given how similar the protein paralogs can be, the transcripts were aligned and the SRA results were mapped onto the alignments, so that differences between paralogs could be easily identified and the unique transcript verified. The reads for the SRA experiments were typically 101 nucleotides and generally abundant enough to identify unique differences between the different genes (see Additional file 4). The transcript alignments begin at the predicted start site and end at the predicted stop codon. Different groups of ZFPs had different size transcripts with 2i-A and B genes containing 447 to 615 nucleotides and 2i-C 798 to 1155 bases. The differences between paralogs varied from four to seven substitutions in Zat17-like transcripts to 31 to 130 in Zat5-like genes (see Additional file 4). Generally, SRA coverage could be found in the roots, leaves or flower buds (see Additional file 4 Table 1). Three genes BnaAZFP7, BnaCZFP12 and BnaCZFP17 did not have adequate SRA coverage and therefore it is unclear whether these genes are expressed. Only one of four 2i-X genes (BnaCZFP33) could be found in the SRA data examined. At this time, the expression of 2i-X B. napus genes BnaCZFP20, BnaCZFP21 and BnaAZFP31 could not be confirmed. Consequently, the SRA data confirmed that 68 unique B. napus ZFPs were expressed. The SRA data also confirmed that the “introns” predicted in many of the 2i-C genes were retained in the transcript leading to a larger protein than predicted in the database.\n              ConclusionsWhile there are 18 2i ZFPs in Arabidopsis, there are 37 in B. oleracea, 35 in rapa and 74 in napus. Given that a whole genome duplication occurred in the Brassica genome ~<U+2009>4 million years after its split from the Arabidopsis progenitor, the twofold increase in these ZFPs in diploid Brassicas reflects the whole genome duplication [14]. The B. oleracea and rapa genomes also fused to form B. napus ~<U+2009>7500 years ago, and this resulted in doubling again the number of ZFPs [18]. Remarkably, most of these B. napus ZFPs are transcribed (see Additional file 4). Generally, this increase in genes creates an imbalance in gene expression and causes, over time, a reduction in expression of the excess genes. Whether these additional ZFPs have unique niches in expression or interactions with other proteins has yet to be determined.The two fingered ZFPS of Arabidopsis fall into five groups based on their protein sequences (2i-A-D with outlier X) [3]. Aside from protein sequence similarity it is unclear whether these different phylogenetic groups play a different role in expression or interaction with different proteins. Most ZFPs have been studied one gene at a time and one group does not seem to fall into any specific expression category. ZFPs are often induced by a stress (biotic and/or abiotic) and due to the EAR motif, act to negatively regulate genes that they bind. ZFPs may modulate the stress response by binding activator transcription factors via the zinc fingers while the EAR motif binds to bridging proteins such as TPL or TPL-like proteins in Arabidopsis that subsequently interacts with HDAC proteins such as HDA19. This interaction results in tightening of the DNA region to which the zinc fingers bind [27, 29]. Ectopic expression of ZFPs can lead to an increase in tolerance to specific stresses [5]. In addition, three amino acid changes in the EAR domain of the Arabidopsis ZFP, ZAT7, results in plants with lower salinity tolerance [30]. Thus, the EAR motif is integral to the enhanced tolerance. How the over-expression of a negative regulator results in increased tolerance is also not apparent. OE-Zat18 a 2i-A member enhances drought tolerance [31]. Several other 2i groups of ZFPs enhance salt tolerance when over-expressed such as Zat7 (2i-B) Zat10 and Zat6 (2i-D) [30, 32, 33]. Thus the protein sequence phylogeny of the ZFP may not predict the effect it might have on stress tolerance.This work identifies ZFPs from three genomes that are related but have diverged over evolutionary time. It is remarkable that the B. napus genome appears to maintain expression of most of the ZFPs from B. oleracea and B. rapa. Identifying the expression pattern of the homologs in the different species may identify niches unique to the different ZFPs. This work is only a beginning, outlining what variation in two fingered Q-type ZFPs exists in these species. Considering the evolution of these species, it seems remarkable that given the minor differences found within the ZFP proteins of the individual Brassica diploids, RNA-Seq data confirms at least 68 of the B. napus genes are expressed. Given the improvements in tolerance to stresses previously identified in ZFPs over-expressed in Arabidopsis [5], manipulation of the Brassica ZFPs may improve stress tolerance in these important agronomic crops.Abbreviations\n                BnaA: \n                    Brassica napus A genome\n                  BnaC: \n                    Brassica napus C genome\n                  Bo: \n                    \n                      Brassica oleracea\n                    \n                  Br: \n                    \n                      Brassica rapa\n                    \n                  EAR: \n                    ethylene-responsive element-binding factor (ERF)-associated amphiphilic repression\n                  Mya: \n                    million years ago\n                  NCBI: \n                    National Center for Biotechnology Information\n                  SRA: \n                    Sequence read archive\n                  ZFP: \n                    Q-type C2H2 zinc finger proteins\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsWe thank Ms. Laura Vanderploeg for drawing chromosome maps and Dr. Michael Blackburn for revising the phylogenetic tree.

Initially proclaimed as a dogma in 1988 and later incorporated into the SDD model where the broad diffusion of Bcd throughout the embryo was the predominant step leading to gradient formation, the SDD model was irrefutable for more than two decades until first doubts were raised in 2007 regarding the diffusion properties of Bcd associated with the SDD model. This led to re-thinking of the issue and the definition of a new model, termed the ARTS model which could explain most of the physical constraints that were inherently associated with the SDD model. In the ARTS model, gradient formation is mediated by the mRNA which is redistributed along cortical microtubules to form a mRNA gradient which is translated to form the protein gradient. Contrary to the SDD model, there is no Bcd diffusion from the tip. The ARTS model is also compatible with the observed cortical movement of Bcd. I will critically compare the SDD and the ARTS models as well as other models, analyze the major differences, and highlight the path where Bcd is localized during early nuclear cycles.Keywords\n                Bicoid\n              GradientmRNAARTSSDDHistory of mechanisms to explain the occurrence of the Bicoid morphogen gradientProclamation of the SDD model as a dogma in the 80’s\n                The Bicoid (Bcd) protein and its gradient (Fig. 1f) is one of the fascinating observations in nature. Discovered in the fruit fly, Drosophila during the late 80’s [1, 2], it was illustrated in textbooks as a paradigm for morphogen gradient formation. Not only was the morphogen gradient beautiful by appearance, it was also remarkable how the embryo managed to generate an anterior-posterior (A-P) gradient and a coordinate system based on information which initially is stored as a point source as maternal mRNA (Fig. 1a). Within 3 h of development, a precise gradient is generated revealing an exponential decay (Fig. 1f) which strictly follows mathematical rules [3]. bcd resides at the top of the hierarchy of segmentation genes [4] to pattern the A-P axis and instructs the gap genes [5] via its concentration gradient from the anterior side. The gap genes, in turn, are expressed in broader domains along the A-P axis and control the so-called pair-rule genes which are usually expressed in 7 stripes [6]. These, in turn, control the segment polarity genes (also referred to segmentation genes) [7] that further subdivide the embryo into smaller units. Finally, homeotic genes are thought the maintain the status of the established segments [8].\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Comparison of Bcd gradient formation, as explained by the ARTS and the SDD models. Pictures represent midsagittal confocal planes or schematic drawings of embryos oriented with their dorsal side up and anterior to the left. Relative intensities of the crude confocal pictures were converted to a color scale with values of 0–255 (8-bit), as shown in inserts of (a) and (f), respectively. Nomenclature of nuclear cycles follows that of [28]. (a) freshly fertilized embryo stained for bcd mRNA. (b, c) in the ARTS (active RNA transport, synthesis) model, the bcd mRNA (red, arrows) is actively transported along microtubules (b, green) to form the mRNA gradient. The mRNA gradient then serves as template for translation of the Bcd protein to form the protein gradient (c, blue). (d, e) in the SDD (synthesis, diffusion, degradation) model, the mRNA (d, red) is proposed to stay at the tip at all times. The mRNA is translated to produce the Bcd protein (d, blue) which diffuses throughout the whole embryo (e). After 3 h, the nuclei at the 14th nuclear cycle are filled with Bcd protein which forms a precise morphogen gradient (f). Please note that for both models, the start and end points are identical (a, f), but they differ considerably in their mechanisms\n                      \n                The SDD model (S standing for “synthesis”, D for “diffusion” and D for uniform “degradation”) was initially used to explain the establishment of the gradient [2, 9]. The model proposed that the bcd mRNA stays strictly at the tip during all developmental stages (Fig. 1d) serving as template for the production of Bcd which itself diffuses throughout the embryo in all directions (Fig. 1e), followed by uniform degradation. The nuclei do not contribute to the shape of the gradient, but rather function as a tool to interpret the gradient [10].\n                Attempts to validate the model were inconclusive for a long time and it took almost two decades to realize that the diffusion constant of Bcd was far too low to move to the posterior [11] and that SDD model might contain conceptual errors. One of the major drawbacks of the SSD model was its presumption that the Bcd protein diffused throughout the embryo (Fig. 1e). This was fueled by studies where fluorescently labeled dextrane particles injected at the anterior pole were used to simulate the diffusion of Bcd [12]. In retrospect, it was a daring proposal, however, the constraints of this approach were clear from the very beginning. Nevertheless, the approach was too simplistic to assume that a protein would behave like a dextrane particle. Subsequently, other reports measured higher diffusion rates [13–15], calculated to be high enough to explain the SDD diffusion model, corroborated by a recent biophysical model analysis [16].\n              The ARTS model as a solution for most physical constraints\n                In 2009, a new model for Bcd gradient formation was proposed solving most of the physical constraints associated with the apparent slow diffusion constant of Bcd: the ARTS model [17–21], standing for “active RNA transport and synthesis”. The ARTS model incorporates the formation of a bcd mRNA gradient and involves active transport of the mRNA by means of microtubules forming a mRNA gradient first (Fig. 1b), followed by synthesis of the protein based on the mRNA gradient (Fig. 1c). One report showed that the mRNA briefly enters the yolk at nuclear cycle 4 [19]. In summary, while the start and end points of the two proposed mechanisms are identical (Fig. 1a, f), it is the mechanism in between where the ARTS model differs completely from that of the SDD model [21].\n              Another model\n                In 2007, a model was proposed to involve Bcd diffusion combined with nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, but no Bcd degradation [22]. The nuclei would serve as reversible traps that affect and slow down Bcd diffusion, while their increase in number with time would counteract the diffusive spread of Bcd. Notably, the Bcd gradient was predicted to be established before the nuclei migrate to the periphery, i. e. before nc 10. Moreover, the gradient was proposed to remain stationary during the remaining 4 nuclear cycles up to nc 14 when cellularization was reached.\n              Analysis of Bicoid movement in the early Drosophila embryo\n                To precisely monitor the path of Bcd movement during early development, a sensitive approach was developed that allowed for the study of the spatial Bcd movement during the early nuclear cycles using single confocal sections [20]. This study revealed, for the first time, that Bcd moved at the cortex of the egg but never entered the inner portion filled with yolk (Fig. 2a, b), a feature that could not be observed in the past because live imaging of Bcd was largely impossible due to the elevated background from the yolk. Notably, the inner part of the egg, i. e. the yolk acted as a non-permissive territory. The results from this study immediately refuted the SDD model which predicted that Bcd would move throughout the yolk. If the egg was exposed to hypoxia, i. e. by water submersion, it fell into “sleep” and development was halted. However, development resumed when oxygen was restored. The hypoxia technique permitted the monitoring of the movement of Bcd under prolonged sleeping conditions, i. e. for 3 h (Fig. 2c) or 7 h (Fig. 2d). During this sleeping phase, Bcd still moved slowly at the cortex to the posterior. Again, the speed and location of Bcd movement was not compatible with the diffusion properties claimed by the SDD model [20], nor with that from the nucleocytoplasmic shuttle model [22]. Notably, the inner part of the egg, i. e. the yolk still acted as a non-permissive territory (Fig. 2c, d; [20]. This finding was unexpected, based on the previous knowledge of the diffusion of fluorescent dextrane particles which easily entered the yolk [12]. Data published concurrently by [20] reiterated the notion that the mechanism for Bcd movement was presumably far more complex than previously anticipated. Experiments demonstrated that embryos exposed to smaller drugs directed against major cytoarchitectural proteins such as microtubules (MTs) or actin, also affected Bcd movement (Fig. 2e-f; [20]. Intact MTs appeared to be indispensable for maintaining a non-permissive territory (Fig. 2e). If actin was compromised, Bcd movement as well as its stability was affected leading to a substantially-altered Bcd pattern (Fig. 2f). This data suggested that actin has a dual function for Bcd.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Cortical movement of Bcd and how drugs affect movement and stability of the Bcd protein. Pictures represent midsagittal confocal planes of bcd+<U+2009>5<U+2009>+<U+2009>8 embryos [20] that produce 3 times more Bcd protein than in wild-type, oriented with their dorsal side up and anterior to the left. Relative intensities of the crude confocal pictures were converted to a color scale with values of 0–255 (8-bit), shown in insert of (f). Nomenclature of nuclear cycles (in green) follows that of [28]. Red areas in (a-d, f) represents the yolk. a untreated nuclear cycle (nc) 4 embryo showing the majority of the Bcd protein at the tip and a small gradient is observed. The yolk part (red) serves as a non-permissive territory for Bcd which refutes the SDD model (Fig. 1e). b untreated nc 8 embryo showing the Bcd protein moving along the cortex to the posterior. The yolk part (red) serves as a non-permissive territory. (c, d) nc 6 embryos exposed to hypoxia and “sleeping” [20] for 3 h (c) or 7 h (d), Bcd still moves along the cortex. Under hypoxic conditions, the yolk (red) still serves as non-permissive territory of Bcd movement. e nc 6 embryo exposed to vinblastine affecting microtubular (MT) stability, the yolk becomes permissive and Bcd moves to the posterior in a broad front (blue arrows), as the SDD model would have predicted (Fig. 1e). (f) nc 6 embryo exposed to latrunculin B affecting actin structures, the stability of Bcd is strongly affected, as well as posterior movement is slowed down. The yolk (red) still retains its non-permissiveness\n                      \n              State of the artThe SDD model is possible under artificial conditions\n                The drug treatment data of [20] revealed that the inner part of the egg, i. e. the yolk became permissive for Bcd if embryos were bathed in substances affecting the cytoarchitecture. In vinblastine-treated embryos, the Bcd protein movement behaved exactly as the SDD model would have predicted, i. e. it moved to the posterior in a broad front (Fig. 2e) and the yolk became permissive for Bcd. However, these are artificial conditions since embryos are not exposed to vinblastine in nature. This observation also revealed several apparent weaknesses of the SDD model that were never before discussed. If the model was correct, why should the embryo translate a protein at the tip while the majority remains in the interior of the embryo, never reaching the blastoderm nuclei? Secondly, how would an insect egg three times the size of Drosophila, e. g. that of the blow fly Lucilia sericata [18, 23] solve the problem of Bcd movement through the yolk where the expansive distance in this large embryo creates further physical constraints? Thirdly, why would nature choose such a difficult path from the tip through the yolk, and then back to the cortex to enter the blastoderm nuclei?\n              Why does Bcd not enter the yolk?\n                Data on the content and structure of the inner yolk is limited, primarily due to microscopic constraints, because the laser of a confocal microscope cannot penetrate deeply into the optically dense yolk layer. Actin microfilaments in the inner yolk were described [24, 25], but require a more detailed description. For MTs, only the spindle apparatus during the nuclear cycles were bright enough to become visible [18]. Further, attempts to stain an internal MT network for visualizing axial expansion and cortical migration had apparently failed [26, 27]. It is possible that the appearance of a MT-network involved in axial expansion and cortical expansion is nuclear cycle-dependent and consequently may be visible only for a fraction of the cycle, as was the case for the cortical MT network transporting the bcd mRNA along the cortex [18]. It is plausible to assume that the yolk contains a plethora of cytoskeletal elements that so far have escaped detection. For example, [28] described the existence of long fibrous materials, presumably of MT-origin, that were observed when embryos were squashed under certain salt conditions and the yolk content examined.\n              Existence of different Bcd isoforms\n                Currently, little data is known regarding the alternative splicing of the bcd gene resulting in 5 different isoforms, some of which have been characterized [29, 30]. Of these, isoform A [31] represents a small homeobox-less isoform, 149 amino acids (aa) in size which is expressed at vanishingly low levels [30] and therefore was likely undetected by the assay of [20]. The four other isoforms differ in differential use of a splice-acceptor site at exon 3 which is 15 nucleotides apart giving rise to a protein with 5 extra amino acids (+<U+2009>5 aa), combined with the alternative use of a translation start point further downstream. The combination of these events allows for the creation of 4 larger Bcd isoforms of 413, 418, 489 and 494 aa, respectively [31]. Interestingly, the +<U+2009>5 aa form is expressed as strongly as the commonly-used Bcd isoform lacking these 5 amino acids (unpublished data). However, given the prevalence of alternative splicing immediately upstream of the homeodomain, it was striking to learn that this splicing event was not found to occur in a close relative of D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura [32], that gave rise to the -<U+2009>5 aa isoform only. All studies using a bcd cDNA in the past were done based on the original c53.46.6 bcd cDNA clone [1] encoding the -<U+2009>5 aa form. This form allowed rescue of a bcd-null phenotype [33], however, it was unknown to what extent any changes of the anlagen under the rescue conditions were corrected, in analogy to the active fate map repair system in bcd+<U+2009>5<U+2009>+<U+2009>8 embryos that allowed the rescue of embryos with severely altered Even-skipped stripe patterns and thus substantially changed segmental anlagen [20, 34]. A likely scenario could be that the Bcd protein movement as well as its function could be largely dependent on isoforms, a question which has not been addressed. Furthermore, the smallest isoform with 149 aa likely has the capacity to travel faster to the posterior and may be the factor responsible for suppressing pole cell formation as demonstrated in [20]. Consistent with this observation is data that over-expression of the smallest Bcd isoform during oogenesis alters the segmental anlagen in the posterior and concomitantly suppresses pole cell-formation (unpublished data). The smallest Bcd isoform may also be responsible for the surprisingly robust signal resulting from hub activity of Bcd observed at the posterior end [35], despite the fact that only low concentrations of Bcd were measured at the posterior pole [36]. Unfortunately, the experimental setup of [35] did not allow to discriminate between the different Bcd isoforms to give a hint which isoform was actually detected. To resolve the issue of Bcd isoform movement and function, sensitive isoform-specific antibodies would be required, experiments that would be technically challenging, but not impossible.\n              Is active transport of Bcd possible?\n                This question was discussed by [11] in an effort to explain the low diffusion constant of Bcd. An interaction database of FlyBase [31] lists a number of Bcd-interacting proteins such as Bin 1 and Bin 3 [37, 38], Chip [39], Dampened [40], elF4EHP [41] and Fate-shifted [42]. Of these proteins, none were directly associated with a motor protein, thus, any interaction partner may require further proteins linking Bcd to a motor machinery which so far has not been detected. In my view, the strongest argument against active long-range transport of Bcd is the existence of the bcd mRNA gradient as the template for the protein gradient [1, 17]. Moreover, the establishment of the mRNA gradient is fast enough to allow for the formation of the Bcd gradient which makes the involvement of active transport of Bcd largely superfluous.\n              ConclusionsWhy does it make sense to observe Bcd residing and moving along the cortex and not moving towards the interior? Arguably, the most important finding is the cortical location of the mRNA (Fig. 1b) and the definition of the yolk and the cortex as territories which have an impact on the movement of Bcd. From an energy point of view, it would be too costly to establish a path associated with the yolk first which would pose further problems on controlling the movement of Bcd. These are the main reasons why today I believe in what I see.Abbreviations\n                ARTS: \n                    Active mRNA transport, synthesis\n                  Bcd: \n                    Bicoid\n                  MT: \n                    Microtubule\n                  SDD: \n                    Synthesis, diffusion, degradation\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsS.

In Drosophila melanogaster, the ATR homologue meiotic 41 (mei-41) is pivotal to DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint signalling. Although various mei-41 mutant alleles have been analyzed in the past, no gain-of-function allele is yet available. To fill this gap, we have generated transgenic flies allowing temporal and tissue-specific induction of mei-41.\n              \n                Results\n                Overexpression of mei-41 in wing and eye anlagen affects proliferation and a G2/M checkpoint even in the absence of genomic stress. Similar consequences were observed following the overexpression of the downstream kinase Grapes (Grp) but not of Loki (Lok), encoding the respective Drosophila Chk1 and Chk2 homologues, in agreement with their previously reported activities. Moreover, we show that irradiation induced cell cycle arrest was prolonged in the presence of ectopic mei-41 expression. Similar to irradiation stress, mei-41 triggered the occurrence of a slower migrating form of Grp, implying specific phosphorylation of Grp in response to either signal. Using a p53R-GFP biosensor, we further show that overexpression of mei-41 was sufficient to elicit a robust p53 activation in vivo.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                We conclude that overexpression of the Drosophila ATR homologue mei-41 elicits an effectual DNA damage response irrespective of irradiation.\n              KeywordsATRDNA damage checkpointMei-41Overexpressionp53 activationBackgroundEnvironmental and intrinsic stressors may impact the integrity of genome, i.e. the DNA, thereby provoking mutations eventually leading to cellular transformation or cell death. DNA damage is combated by a complex interplay of repair mechanisms ensuring the stability of the genome. Studies on DNA damage response (DDR) in a large variety of organisms, be it single cells like yeast or multicellular organisms like Drosophila or mammals, revealed that all organisms have evolved a core of components strikingly conserved across eukaryotes (reviewed in [1–3]). DDR can be envisaged as a cascade of signalling events, starting with the recognition of DNA lesions followed by the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway to cause a temporarily cell cycle arrest thus enabling DNA repair processes to occur (reviewed in [1, 4]). Typical of signalling cascades, DDR is regulated by phosphorylation events mediated by different kinases all belonging to the conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase related protein kinase (PIKK) superfamily (reviewed in [5, 6]). These kinases transmit the signals from the site of DNA damage to the cell cycle machinery by activating cell cycle checkpoints. The G2/M DNA damage checkpoint is critical for the maintenance of genome stability as unrepaired DNA double strand breaks (DSB) may directly cause mistakes in chromosomal segregation to the daughter cells if ending up in the M phase of the cell cycle. Hence, the final exit strategy in multicellular organisms before cellular transformation, and eventually cancer occurs as consequence of DDR is cellular suicide, i.e. apoptosis (reviewed in [7, 8]).The Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) kinases are the central mediators of DDR (reviewed in [5, 6]). ATM is known to orchestrate a global response to DSB in higher organisms including DNA repair, checkpoint activation and apoptosis. Well characterized targets of ATM are the Chk2 kinase and the tumour suppressor p53, the latter being stabilized upon DNA damage to further initiate specific target gene expression executing cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis, respectively (reviewed in [1, 9]). Whereas ATM is involved primarily in the mammalian DSB response, ATR is activated by a much wider range of genotoxic stresses and appears to be a much more important player in DDR of yeast cells than ATM (reviewed in [2, 6]). Once activated, ATR phosphorylates and activates the protein kinase Chk1, which effects a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition, allowing more time for DNA repair so that cells do not enter mitosis prematurely. Noteworthy, there is considerable crosstalk between the ATM/ATR signal transduction pathways (reviewed in [6, 8]).The Drosophila homologue of ATM is called telomere fusion (tefu), as it was originally identified by its essential role in telomere maintenance [10]. Although tefu is important for p53 activation and DNA damage-induced apoptosis, it has no evident role in cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage [10–14]. Similar to vertebrates, the Drosophila Chk2 homologue loki (lok) regulates p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage as well as to telomere loss [15–21]. The ATR homologue in Drosophila is encoded by meiotic 41 (mei-41). Mutational analyses revealed that mei-41 is indispensable for meiotic recombination checkpoints as well as for DNA damage checkpoints in somatic cells [13, 22–27]. Like its target kinase grapes (grp) (the Drosophila Chk1 homologue), mei-41 is important to postpone the mitosis entry in larval cells after IR-stress [24, 25, 28]. Moreover, mei-41 and grp mutant flies are highly sensitive towards triggers that damage DNA or inhibit DNA replication, and are therefore essential to maintain genomic and chromosomal stability [29–33]. Overall in Drosophila, mei-41 appears to mostly fulfil the roles of both ATM and ATR with regard to DDR, whereas tefu’s primary role is the maintenance of telomeres and triggering apoptosis.Although various mei-41 mutant alleles have been analyzed in the past in Drosophila, no gain-of-function allele is yet available. In order to fill this gap, we generated a mei-41 construct under UAS-control, which allows temporal and tissue-specific expression of mei-41 with the help of the versatile Gal4/UAS system [34]. We show that the overexpression of mei-41 in imaginal tissues is sufficient to induce a G2 arrest constraining the growth of affected tissues. Moreover, in the presence of ectopic Mei-41 cells are hampered to resume the cell cycle after irradiation (IR)-mediated arrest. Upon IR-stress, Grp protein shows retarded mobility, and likewise upon mei-41 overexpression, suggesting that ectopic Mei-41 protein is sufficient to phosphorylate Grp protein. Finally, using a p53-biosensor we show that overexpression of mei-41 effects p53 reporter gene expression in vivo, suggesting a link to the Chk2/lok pathway as well. Overall, our data provide evidence for a mei-41-induced cellular response independent of DDR-mediated mei-41 activation.ResultsGeneration of a mei-41 overexpression construct\n                Aiming for a deeper understanding of the Drosophila DNA damage response, we concentrated on meiotic 41 (mei-41), the Drosophila checkpoint kinase ATR homologue and key player of this process [24, 25]. To study the consequences of mei-41 overexpression, we generated a pUAST-mei-41 construct allowing for tissue-specific induction during fly development with the help of the Gal4/UAS-system [34]. The mei-41 locus contains four small introns (59 bp, 57 bp, 74 bp, 64 bp) and covers more than 8 kb; there is no complete cDNA available (7899 bp) (see http://flybase.org for further details). We therefore decided to PCR-amplify genomic DNA in four smaller fragments to be fused to cover the entire open reading frame, and clone it into the pUAST vector (Fig. 1a). Transgenic lines were established, tested and a third chromosomal insertion (3.3) line was used for further experiments. Overexpression of mei-41 in the posterior compartment of wing imaginal discs using en-Gal4-GFP was demonstrated by in situ hybridization with a mei-41 specific probe (Fig. 1b). Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed about a 500-fold induction when UAS-mei41 was ubiquitously induced with da-Gal4 during larval development relative to the endogenous mei-41 expression levels (Fig. 1c). We conclude that the UAS-mei-41 construct is well suited for overexpression studies during Drosophila development.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Generation of a UAS-mei-41 overexpression line. (a) Cloning scheme of the pUAST-mei-41 construct. Coloured line corresponds to the mei-41 gene; intron positions are depicted as pale dashes. Segments derived from plasmid vectors are depicted in black and are not to scale. Genomic mei-41 DNA was PCR-amplified in fragments I-IV, which were eventually merged and shuttled into pUAST transformation vector in the correct 5'-3' orientation. (b) UAS-mei-41 flies were crossed to en-Gal4-GFP, and induction of mei-41 expression was visualized in the posterior compartment of a wing imaginal disc by in situ hybridization (arrow). Size bar represents 100 µm. (c) Overexpression of mei-41 was quantified by qRT-PCR. To this end, UAS-mei-41 was ubiquitously induced with da-Gal4, and mRNA isolated from third instar larvae. Compared to control (da::lacZ), mei-41 is about 500-fold overexpressed. Data were assembled from three biological and two technical replicates. Mini-max depicts 95% confidence, median corresponds to expression ratio. Gapdh and beta-Tubulin56D served as reference genes. Efficiencies for mei-41 (0.92), for gapdh (0.94) and for beta-Tubulin56D (0.95) were accounted for determining relative quantities [44]\n                      \n              Overexpression of mei-41 affects entry into mitosis\n                Primary to DDR is checkpoint activation, i.e. slowing down the entry into mitosis to allow time for repair [5]. We wondered whether the overexpression of mei-41 without further activation by DNA damaging compounds might suffice to affect cell cycle regulation. To this end, we induced mei-41 in the posterior compartment of the wing disc using en-Gal4-GFP, and monitored cells in M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 2). Cells in mitotic phase were visualized with anti-Phospho-Histone H3 (PH3) antibody staining and counted in the posterior compartment. Then their numbers were related to the whole wing disc size. As negative control, we overexpressed UAS-lacZ. Moreover, we included both downstream kinase Chk1/2 homologues grapes (grp) and loki (lok), since overexpression studies so far had not included cell cycle analyses in imaginal tissue [10, 16, 18]. It has been shown earlier that grp has a major role in the DNA replication checkpoint, whereas the primary role of lok is p53-mediated apoptosis in response to IR [16, 18, 19, 25, 28, 35].\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Overexpression of mei-41 induces G2/M cell cycle arrest. (a-d) The checkpoint kinases mei-41, grp and lok (chk2) as indicated were overexpressed in the posterior compartment of wing imaginal discs using en-Gal4-GFP (green) (b-d). UAS-lacZ served as control (a). To image M phase, discs were stained with anti-Phospho-Histone H3 (PH3) antibodies (red) indicating the number of mitotic cells. GFP labelling was used to determine the antero-posterior boundary (dotted line). (e) Quantification of PH3 signals showed significant downregulation upon overexpression of mei-41 and grp but not of lok. Significance was tested by ANOVA two-tailed Tukey-Kramer approach (** p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01; * p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05; ns: not significant). Bars represent standard error (SEM) from 13 to 17 analyzed discs per genotype. Size bar represents 100 µm in all panels\n                      \n                Quantification of the results allowed us to uncover a significant reduction in the number of mitotic cells upon the overexpression of either mei-41 or grp, but not of lok (Fig. 2a-e). This is in agreement with earlier reports that mei-41 and grp are involved in cell cycle arrest in Drosophila cells and tissues, with a minor contribution of lok [16, 18, 25, 28]. We confirmed that the reduced number of mitotic cells after mei-41 or grp overexpression were not a consequence of apoptosis, as no increase of cleaved Caspase-3 activity was detected in the posterior compartment of the discs (see Additional file 1: Figure S1). Our results therefore demonstrate that both, mei-41 and grp, act on cell cycle regulation in a dose dependent manner, in contrast to lok. Our data conform to the requirements of mei-41 and grp in G2/M checkpoint function [24, 25]. Moreover, they demonstrate that our newly generated inducible mei-41 construct is a valuable tool for further analysis of mei-41 roles in a gain-of-function background, complementing the information gathered so far in a mei-41 loss-of-function background.\n              Ectopic induction of mei-41 during imaginal development reduces adult tissue size\n                To study the effects of mei-41 overexpression on adult tissue size, we ectopically induced mei-41 during proliferative phases of eye and wing development. Overexpression of mei-41 in the anterior part of the developing eye disc using ey-Gal4 resulted in a profound reduction of adult eye size (Fig. 3a). This growth defect is not restricted to the eye since overexpression of mei-41 in the posterior compartment of the developing wing disc using en-Gal4-GFP reduced its size within the adult wing significantly, whereas the size of the anterior compartment was unaffected (Fig. 3b). We did not observe any disturbance of wing and venation morphology, implying that growth but not differentiation or patterning of the tissue was affected (Fig. 3b).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Overexpression of mei-41 results in smaller adult tissue size. (a) UAS-mei-41 was overexpressed during eye development using ey-Gal4; likewise was UAS-lacZ serving as control. Eye size of adult female flies was measured as indicated. Compared to the control, mei-41 overexpression caused a significant decrease in eye size (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>26). (b) Effects on tissue size of the overexpression of UAS-mei-41 with en-Gal4-GFP in the posterior compartment of the developing wing were compared to those of the control UAS-lacZ (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>20). Size of anterior and posterior compartments was measured as indicated. Whereas no difference was detected in the anterior (a), the posterior compartment (p, shaded grey) was significantly smaller when mei-41 was overexpressed. Longitudinal veins L1-L5 are labelled. Data are depicted as boxplots with center lines showing the medians, box limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles as determined by BoxPlotR software; whiskers extend 1.5 times the interquartile range. Statistics were done using ANOVA, and significance determined with Dunnett’s approach (*** p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001)\n                      \n                So far, our data suggest that overexpression of mei-41 is sufficient for the induction of a cell cycle arrest without affecting development. The effect is very mild though, and only apparent in a quantitative approach, which may be explained by the lack of kinase activation by genotoxic stress. We cannot rule out the formal explanation, however, that the excessive amounts of Mei-41 kinase may generally interfere with other aspects of cell growth and proliferation. For example, ATM/ATR kinases must be tightly regulated in order to prevent aberrant activation of DDR. It is thought that the availability of specific protein cofactors, required for kinase recruitment to DNA damage sites, restricts kinase activity. ATR forms a heterodimer with its obligate partner ATRIP during the sensing of DNA damage in the course of DDR (reviewed in [6, 8]), and so does Drosophila Mei-41 with the ATRIP homologue Mus 304 [25]. We propose that Mus 304 may be limiting the effects of mei-41 overexpression, as the gene is expressed only about threefold of mei-41 (http://flybase.org).\n              Irradiation induced G2/M checkpoint is extended in mei-41 overexpressing cells\n                We know from the literature that mei-41 is indispensable for the irradiation induced G2/M checkpoint [13, 22, 25]. Likewise, the combined activity of grp and lok is required, with a minor contribution of the latter [16, 18, 25, 28]. Accordingly, we wondered how overexpression of mei-41, grp or lok may affect the cellular response to irradiation. Larvae overexpressing the respective constructs in the posterior compartment of imaginal discs were exposed to 40 Gy IR. PH3 staining uncovered cells in early mitosis in wing imaginal discs: as expected, IR-induced a G2/M checkpoint as very few cells entered mitosis 1 h after irradiation (Fig. 4a, b). Cell cycle arrest is induced and maintained to allow sufficient time for DNA repair, and eventually the cell to recover from DNA damage and resume cell cycle. Accordingly, cells start to re-enter mitosis, seen by increasing numbers of PH3 positive cells over time. In the control, we observed rising numbers of PH3 positive cells already at 4 h post-IR, becoming considerably numerous 6 h later (Fig. 4a, b). A likewise increase was observed in the anterior compartment of the irradiated discs from larvae overexpressing either mei-41, grp or lok. In the posterior compartment, however, i.e. in cells overexpressing mei-41, re-entry into the cell cycle was considerably hampered even after 6 h recovery time (Fig. 4a, b), presumably by keeping the DSB damage checkpoint active. We expect both, the endogenous as well as the overexpressed Mei-41 kinase to be activated in response to IR-stress. Consequently, cells are expected to be flooded by activated Mei-41, keeping them from resuming mitosis entry. Even several hours post-IR, activated Mei-41 levels apparently surpass the threshold for a G2/M checkpoint.\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Cell cycle re-entry is delayed in cells overexpressing mei-41. (a) The indicated kinase or the lacZ control was overexpressed in the posterior compartment of wing imaginal discs using en-Gal4-GFP. Third instar larvae of the given genotypes were irradiated with 40 Gy and allowed to recover for one, four and six hours (1 h, 4 h, 6 h aIR) respectively, before dissection of the wing imaginal discs. Mitotic cells are highlighted by Phospho-Histone H3 antibody staining (red). GFP labelling was used to determine the antero-posterior boundary (indicated by the dotted line). IR-stress caused a cell cycle arrest, only few cells appear in M phase one hour after irradiation. Entry into mitosis reappears with time in the control (enGFP::lacZ), as well as in the anterior compartment of all genotypes as DNA damage response proceeds. Not so in the posterior compartment, though, where either mei-41 or lok is overexpressed. However, overexpression of grp allowed the cell cycle to resume 6 h post-IR. Size bar represents 100 µm in all panels. (b) Quantification of PH3 signals in the posterior compartment reveals no significant difference amongst the different genotypes 1 h after irradiation (aIR). Re-entry into mitosis is observed in the wild type but not the other genotypes at 4 h aIR. Even at 6 h aIR, significantly less mitotic cells are observed in the posterior compartments overexpressing either mei-41 or lok, whereas grp overexpression had only minor lasting effects. *** p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; ** p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01; * p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.5; ns, not significant) according to ANOVA two-tailed Tukey-Kramer approach for multiple comparisons. Bars represent standard of the mean (SEM). At least 16 wing discs were analyzed for each genotype and time point\n                      \n                Overexpression of grp had a much milder effect: 4 h after irradiation, cell cycle had not yet resumed, whereas after 6 h, the number of mitotic cells was approaching that of the control (Fig. 4a, b). These data indicate that grp overexpression slowed down cell cycle re-entry, but not as efficiently as mei-41 overexpression. This result may be expected, since grp encodes the effector kinase downstream of mei-41: IR-stress activates endogenous Mei-41 kinase which phosphorylates and activates the effector kinase Grp. In the presence of abundant Grp protein, this response will be intensified and longer lasting. Therefore, we expect cell recovery to lag behind, i.e. grp to mirror but not to match mei-41 overexpression.\n                Overexpression of lok, however, had a similar effect as mei-41 overexpression (Fig. 4a, b), which, at first glance, came as a surprise: cell cycle re-entry appeared delayed even at 6 h after irradiation, i.e. the number of PH3 positive cells was still reduced. However, we had not observed any effect of lok overexpression on cell cycle regulation in the absence of IR-stress (Fig. 2a), in agreement with the many reports on the supplemental role of lok for the G2/M checkpoint [25, 28]. Instead, the specific role for lok in the activation of p53-mediated cell death is well established [15, 16, 25]. Thus, we wondered whether the lack of PH3 positive lok overexpressing cells several hours post-IR indeed reflected failure of cell cycle re-entry, or alternatively might be explained by IR-induced lok-mediated apoptosis. To this end, although no signs of cell death were observed in unstressed discs where lok was overexpressed (Fig. 2), we repeated the experiment, now addressing apoptosis induction by IR-stress with 6 h recovery time. Indeed, in response to IR-stress accumulation of cleaved Caspase-3 was detected most prominently in the central part of the wing disc in all genotypes (see Additional file 1: Figure S2). In contrast to the discs overexpressing either lacZ, mei-41 or grp, however, lok overexpressing cells showed a much stronger apoptotic response than any of the others (see Additional file 1: Figure S2). We conclude that the lower numbers of PH3 positive cells present in lok overexpressing tissue may result primarily from an increase in apoptosis rather than from a delay of cell cycle re-entry.\n              Mobility shift of Grp after mei-41 overexpression\n                Using Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, it has been demonstrated that Grp is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication, and that this phosphorylation was dependent on the presence of Mei-41 [28]. Presumably, the Drosophila ATR homologue Mei-41 phosphorylates Grp in the process of DDR, comparable to what is known from other organisms like yeast, Xenopus and also mammals [2, 3]. As we had seen a dose dependency for mei-41 on checkpoint induction (Fig. 2), we wondered, whether the sole overexpression of mei-41 may suffice to induce Grp phosphorylation, i.e. induce a bona fide DNA damage response. To this end, mei-41 was ubiquitously overexpressed together with a HA-tagged form of Grp using da-Gal4. Larval protein extracts from imaginal discs were separated by Phos-Tag™ PAGE to increase the separation of phosphorylated from unphosphorylated proteins, followed by Western blotting. For negative control, larvae just overexpressing HA-tagged Grp were used; for positive control such larvae had been subjected to 40 Gy IR-stress. Indeed, overexpression of mei-41 resulted HA-tagged Grp to migrate more slowly compared to the negative control, but similar to the one detected 1 h post-IR (Fig. 5). These results suggest, that overexpression of mei-41 is sufficient to induce DDR at low levels, i.e. to activate, respectively phosphorylate its downstream target Grp in vivo.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Overexpression of mei-41 results in an electrophoretic mobility shift of Grp. Mobility of HA-tagged Grp protein was analyzed in response to either irradiation (1 h after 40 Gy IR) or the overexpression of mei-41. Western analysis combined with Phos-Tag™-PAGE was performed using anti-HA antibodies and proteins extracts from imaginal discs of 25 larvae from each genotype. Note similar mobility shift in response to IR or mei-41 overexpression indicative of a phosphorylation of Grp protein. (Genotypes are: da-Gal4/+; da-Gal4/UAS-grp-HA and da-Gal4/+; da-Gal4/UAS-grp-HA UAS-mei-41)\n                      \n              Activation of the p53R-GFP biosensor can be achieved by overexpression of mei-41\n                As outlined above, mei-41 mutants display checkpoint defects that are only matched by grp; lok double mutants, implying that Mei-41 may not only act on Grp but also, to a lesser degree, on Lok [16, 25, 28]. Genetic and molecular data imply that Lok, but not Grp, is an activator of p53 in response to DNA damage in Drosophila [16, 25]. To investigate a potential cross-regulatory effect of the Drosophila ATR homologue Mei-41 on p53 activity we made use of a p53R-GFP biosensor, where p53 activation is reflected by nuclear GFP accumulation [36]. This p53R-GFP biosensor is activated during meiosis in the female germline, as well as in response to genotoxic stress in somatic tissues [36–38]. Thus, it is well suited to determine whether mei-41 overexpression alone may suffice to effect p53 activation. UAS-mei-41 was ubiquitously overexpressed with da-Gal4 in the background of the p53R-GFP reporter, and the giant salivary gland nuclei were examined for accumulation of GFP. GFP signal intensity was measured, using nuclear Putzig (Pzg) protein [39] as internal standard. For control, p53R-GFP nuclear localization was evaluated after ectopic induction of either Lok or Grp as well. As expected from its ability to activate p53 [16, 18, 19], overexpression of lok caused a strong nuclear GFP signal, which was well above lacZ control, demonstrating the reliability of our test system (Fig. 6a, b). Interestingly, overexpression of mei-41 was sufficient to induce nuclear p53R-GFP accumulation, albeit much weaker than that of lok (Fig. 6a, b). In contrast, Grp was unable to trigger measurable GFP signals (Fig. 6a, b). In addition to the visual assessment, qRT-PCR measurements of GFP expression levels were conducted on larval imaginal discs. They uncovered a 27-fold and 5-fold increase of p53-GFP reporter expression, respectively, in response to ubiquitous lok and mei-41 overexpression in comparison to the lacZ control (Fig. 6c). These data provide unambiguous evidence that ectopic Mei-41 is able to induce p53 activity. Whether this activation is direct, as shown for ATM as well as ATR (reviewed in [6, 8]), or indirect via Lok, requires further investigations. Our newly established UAS-mei-41 construct is well suited to facilitate future analyses.\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        Response of the p53R-GFP reporter on mei-41 overexpression. (a) In response to p53 activation, nuclear GFP is expressed from the p53R-GFP reporter [36]. This system was used to assay p53 activation in consequence of the overexpression of either lok, mei-41 or grp; lacZ served as control. Salivary glands were analyzed; their nuclei visualized with the nuclear marker Pzg [39]. In contrast to lacZ and grp, overexpression of lok and to a lesser degree mei-41 resulted in a robust induction of the p53R-GFP reporter. Size bar represents 100 µm in all panels. (b) Quantification of nuclear p53R-GFP intensity was determined relative to the mean intensity of the nuclear marker protein Pzg (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>84). Induction of lok strongly induced p53R-GFP nuclear accumulation. Also mei-41 caused a significant nuclear accumulation of p53R-GFP, whereas grp did not. *** p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001; ** p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01; ns. not significant according to ANOVA two tailed Dunnet’s approach.

Overexpression of lok and mei-41 with da-Gal4 considerably increased p53R-GFP reporter gene activity in relation to the lacZ-control: lok 27.5-fold, mei-41 4.9-fold and grp 1.6-fold. Data were assembled from four biological and two technical replicates. Mini-max depicts 95% confidence, median corresponds to expression ratio. As reference genes, cyp33 and Tbp were used. Efficiencies for GFP (0.91), for cyp33 (0.96) and Tbp (0.95) were accounted for in determining relative quantities [44]\n                      \n              DiscussionIn this work, we show that mei-41 and grp act on cell cycle regulation in a dose dependent manner, conforming to the requirements of mei-41 and grp in G2/M checkpoint function [24, 25]. Whereas developmental patterning is unaffected, a cell cycle arrest and proliferation defects result from the overexpression of mei-41. Moreover, we unambiguously show that p53 activity is induced by ectopic Mei-41. We do not know, however, whether this activation is direct, as shown for ATM as well as ATR (reviewed in [6, 8]), or indirect via Lok. The defects resulting from Mei-41 overexpression are very mild, however, both regarding cell cycle delay, cell proliferation or apoptosis, compared to a normal irradiation response. There are several explanations. For example, during genotoxic stress Mei-41 kinase is activated by phosphorylation, which does not follow the overexpression. Moreover, Mei-41 heterodimerizes with its obligate partner Mus 304 [25] during damage response [6, 8]. In our overexpression experiments, Mus 304 may be limiting, allowing only for the mild effects observed. Finally, excessive amounts of Mei-41 kinase resulting from the overexpression may generally interfere with other aspects of cell growth and proliferation.ConclusionsOverexpression of the Drosophila ATR homologue mei-41 during imaginal development is sufficient to initiate a cellular response resembling the DNA damage response, which is reflected by the induction of a G2/M checkpoint, growth retardation, apparent phosphorylation of the effector kinase Grp (Drosophila Chk1), as well as the activation of p53. The rather subtle effects presumably result from a lack of Mei-41 kinase activation by genotoxic stress, as IR resulted in long-lasting checkpoint activation. Moreover, the observation of p53 activation in response to mei-41 overexpression indicates cross-talk of ATR/ATM pathways also in Drosophila that may involve the effector kinase Lok (Drosophila Chk2).MethodsCloning of pUAST-mei-41 and generation of transgenic flies\n                Four fragments covering mei-41 were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA, and subcloned individually in pBT vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA) (fragments I-III) or pGX-attP [40] (fragment IV) to obtain the following subclones: pBT 2.3 kb NgoMIV/XmaI - EcoRI fragment I (translation start to EcoRI); pBT 2.2 kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment II; pBT 2.7 kb XhoI-Acc65I fragment III; pGX-attP 0.8 kb Acc65I - BglII fragment IV (translation stop). Subsequently fragments I-III were fused by successive cloning in pBT vector. The insert was excised as SacII/Acc65I fragment and cloned into likewise opened pGX-attP harbouring fragment IV. The full length genomic mei-41 construct was excised with BamHI/AvrII and subsequently shuttled into BglII/XbaI of pUAST vector [34] and sequence verified. Three independent transgenic fly lines were established by P-element mediated germline transformation [41]. All three lines were functionally tested for ectopic expression of mei-41 RNA by in situ hybridization of imaginal discs. The subsequent functional assays were performed with line UAS-mei-41 (3.3) inserted on the third chromosome.\n              RNA expression analyses: In situ hybridization and qRT-PCR\n                In situ hybridization on larval wing discs was performed with digoxigenin-labelled DNA probes of mei-41 according to standard protocols [42]. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as outlined earlier [38, 43]. With the PolyATract® System 1000 kit (Promega Mannheim, Germany) poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 20 total third instar larvae for the quantification of UAS-mei-41 expression, and from imaginal discs only attached to the mouth hook from 20 third instar larvae for p53R-GFP biosensor quantification. Real time qPCR was conducted with Blue S’Green qPCR kit (Biozym, Hessisch-Oldendorf, Germany) on 6 ng of cDNA in 10 µl end volume using MIC magnetic induction cycler (bms, Pots Point, Australia) including target and no-template controls. Absence of genomic DNA was tested in a non-RT control. As internal references for mei-41 expression, ßTub56D and gapdh2 were used, whereas cyp33 and Tbp served as internal references in the case of p53R-GFP biosensor quantification. The references were selected based on variance and Cq values. Relative quantification of the data was performed with micPCR software Version 2.6.0 based on REST taking target efficiency into account [44]. At least three biological and two technical replicates were performed. The following primer pairs were used (5' -<U+2009>><U+2009>3'):\n                      mei-41 upper, CTC CTG CAA GAC TTT AAT TCG CTC AC\n                            lower, GCG TTG GCT GCA TGT ACT TCT CA\n                          \n                    \n                      ßTub56D PP17563 DRSC FlyPrimer bank [45]\n                    \n                      gapdh2 PP2976 DRSC FlyPrimer bank [45]\n                    \n                      GFP upper, TCAAGGACGACGGCAACTACAAGAC\n                            lower, TCACCTTGATGCCGTTCTTCTGC\n                          \n                    \n                      cyp33 PP14577 DRSC FlyPrimer bank [45]\n                    \n                      Tbp PP1556 DRSC FlyPrimer bank [45]\n                    \n              Fly work and immunochemistry\n                Flies were raised on standard corn-molasses food at 25 °C. The following strains were used: da-Gal4 (BL55849); en-Gal4-GFP [46], UAS-lacZ (BL8530), UAS-mei-41 (this work), UAS-grapes.ORF.3xHA (F000934; obtained from FlyORF; Zürich, Switzerland) [47], UAS-chk2 (lok) (gift of U. Abdu) [48], UASp-lacZ [49], p53R-GFP [36]. Staining of third instar wing imaginal discs or salivary glands was done according to standard protocols as described earlier [38, 50] using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotech, Dallas, USA), guinea pig anti-Pzg (1:1000) [39], rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (1:250; Cell Signaling, Germany) and rabbit anti-Phospho-Histone H3 (PH3) (1:50; Cell Signaling, Germany). Secondary antibodies from goat or donkey, coupled to FITC or Cy3, were obtained from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Larval tissue was documented by confocal microscopy using a MRC1024 confocal scan head coupled to a Zeiss Axiophot (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) and LaserSharp 2000 imaging software. Pictures were compiled with Corel Photo Paint and Corel Draw software.\n              Ionizing radiation (IR) treatment and Phos-Tag™ based mobility shift detection\n                Third instar larvae were irradiated with 40 Gy using Elektra Versa HD linear accelerator (Elektra Instrument AB; Stockholm; Sweden) at the Marienhospital Stuttgart. To investigate phosphorylation of Grp protein, 25 third instar larvae of the genotype da-Gal4/+; da-Gal4/UAS-grp-HA were irradiated with 40 Gy. After 1 h recovery time, imaginal discs connected to the mouth hook were isolated and homogenized in 50 µl binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, ROCHE complete ULTRA protease inhibitor mini tablet). The unirradiated controls as well as the da-Gal4/+; da-Gal4/UAS-grp-HA UAS-mei-41 larval tissues were treated likewise. The homogenates were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE including 50 µM Phos-Tag™ Acrylamide solution (#AAL-7, Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) and 100 µM MnCl2 at 70 V for 22-24 h at 8 °C. After blotting on PVDF membrane (BioRad, Munic, Germany), HA-tagged Grapes was detected with rat anti-HA (1:2500, Roche Diagnostic, Basel, Switzerland), and secondary anti-rat antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (1:1000; Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories via Dianova, Hamburg, Germany).\n              Documentation and statistical evaluation of larval and adult tissue\n                Cells in M phase within the posterior compartment were counted based on PH3 signals. The posterior compartment was determined by GFP labelling from en-Gal4-GFP [46]. Cell number was related to total size of the respective wing discs using ImageJ. p53R-GFP expression in salivary glands was examined by measuring signal intensity of 12 nuclei from seven different glands each (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>84 nuclei), using the mean intensity of Pzg signals as internal standard. Wings from female flies were dehydrated in ethanol, mounted in Euparal (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and documented with an ES120 camera (Optronics, Goleta CA, USA) connected to a Zeiss Axiophot (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) using Pixera Viewfinder software, version 2.0. Female flies were etherized before taking pictures from the heads with an ES120 camera coupled to a Leica Wild M3C Stereomicroscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Size of female eyes (UASp-lacZ/+; ey-Gal4/+ and ey-Gal4/+; UAS-mei-41/+) or wings (UASp-lacZ/+; en-Gal4-GFP/+ and en-Gal4-GFP/+; UAS-mei-41/+) was measured using Image J. Statistical analysis was conducted by ANOVA using a two-tailed Tukey-Kramer or Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons. ***p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001 highly significant; **p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01 very significant; *p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 significant; not significant (ns) p<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05. Box plots were compiled using the online plotting tool BoxPlotR (http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/).\n              NotesFabienne E.

DREB1/CBF genes encode DRE-binding proteins with the function as transcript activators.

In each variety, there existed two loci of TaDREB1-D genes, named TaDREB1-D1 and TaDREB1-D2, both of which had the similar nucleotide sequence except an 11 bp insertion in the former. In wheat seeds under osmotic stress, we did not detect the transcript expression level of TaDREB1-A and TaDREB1-B, but that of TaDREB1-D.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The capacity of osmotic stress tolerance was closely correlated with the expression level and tendency of TaDREB1-D.\n              KeywordsNucleotide polymorphismExpression characteristics\n                TaDREB1\n              Osmotic stress resistanceBackgroundDrought is already widespread in many regions and one of the primary reason causing plant loss worldwide. [1]. Even in many irrigated regions, shortage of water supply allows only limited irrigation. Therefore, it is imperative to strengthen the study on osmotic stress resistance of wheat.Five multi-gene families belong to transcript factors [bZIP (mainly AREB/ABF), DREB (AP2/EREBP), MYB/MYC, NAC and WRKY)] have been reported to be associated with drought tolerance. A number of wheat genes for transcript factors (TabZIP1, TabZIP60, TaABRE3, TaDREB1, TaPIMP1, TaNAC29 and TAWRKY44) have been shown to exhibit the induced expression during exposure to drought stress, suggesting that these genes may be used for improving stress tolerance in wheat [2–9].Dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB) proteins constitute a large family of transcription factors regulating some functional genes closely related to drought, high-salinity and low temperature [10, 11]. Arabidopsis genome has six DREB1/CBF genes, namely DREB1A/CBF3, DREB1B/CBF1, DREB1C/CBF2, DREB1D/CBF4, DDF1/DREB1F and DDF2/DREB1E [12]. DREB genes feature three conserved regions, an EREBP/AP2 DNA binding domain [13, 14], an N-terminal nuclear localization signal, and a conserved Ser/Thr-rich region adjacent to the EREBP/AP2 domain [15, 16]. The characteristics of above three regions determine the DREB characteristics [17]. Most of the functional studies on DREB transcription factors were focused on Arabidopsis thaliana before 2002, and then in wheat, rice, soybean, cotton and other plants [18–24]. DREB factors have been extensively characterized and grouped into several molecular classes based on similarities in the function or the amino acid sequence of the proteins they encode [24]. DREB1 and DREB2 are two main subgroups of the DREB subfamily, involved in two different signal transduction pathways under cold and dehydration, respectively [25]. DREB1 genes include DREB1-A, DREB1-B, DREB1-C,DREB1-D,DREB1-E and DREB1F [26]. TaDREB1 genes were located on chromosomes 3A, 3B and 3D [11], and isolated from a drought-induced cDNA library of wheat, which was found to be induced by low temperature, abscisic acid (ABA), salinity and drought [27]. The cDNA length of TaDREB1 is 1292 bp, including 837 bp open reading frame, 251 bp 5’-UTR and 204 bp 3’-UTR [18]. The study results showed that the heterogeneity of TaDREB1 gene haplotypes is inconsistent in drought-resistant materials or in drought-sensitive wheat materials, indicating the complexity of drought resistance. In addition, the nucleic acid polymorphisms of TaDREB1 gene are richer in wheat [26].The present research aimed at identifying the seed germination resistance varieties under osmotic stress for wheat breeding program, searching the new allelic variation of TaDREB1, looking for SNPs, InDels and transcript expression level associated with seed germination tolerance under osmotic stress, and charactering the transcript expression level of TaDREB1-A, TaDREB1-B and TaDREB1-D in wheat varieties or lines with different values of GDRI (germination drought resistance index).MethodsPlant materials\n                Six spring wheat genotypes were used for cloning of TaDREB1-A, TaDREB1-B and TaDREB1-D genes, including three osmotic stress-resistant genotypes (08–1783, 08–1826 and 07–6239 with relative germination rate values of 55.98, 47.74 and 47.11%, respectively) and three osmotic stress-susceptible ones (08dongzhong 275, Zhangye 1 and 05 cm 178 with relative germination rate values of 1.27, 0.51 and 0%, respectively). Eighty Chinese spring wheat genotypes, with different osmotic stress tolerance from China Spring-sown Wheat Region (CSWR) were used for identifying the osmotic stress tolerance (Table 1). Mature seeds of 08–1783 and Zhangye 1 were used to extract RNA for analysis of mRNA transcription.Table 1\n                        Primer sequence used in this study\n                      PrimerPrimer sequence(5'-3')Fragment size (bp)Anneal temp.(°C)DREB1-A1FCGGAACCACTCCCTCCATCTC110762DREB1-A1RCGGTTGCCCCATTAGACGTCA  DREB1-A2FCTGGCACCTCCATTGCTGAC59963DREB1-A2RAGTACATGAACTCAACGCACAGGACAAC  DREB1-BFCCCAACCCAAGTGATAATAATCT71658DREB1-BRTTGTGCTCCTCATGGGTACTT  DREB1-D1FTCGTCCCTCTTCTCGCTCCAT119063DREB1-D1RGCGGTTGCCCCATTAGACATCG  DREB1-D2FCTGGCACCTCCATTGCCGAT59664DREB1-D2RAGTACATGAACTCAACGCACAGGACAAC  DREB UTCGTCCCTCTTCTCGCTCCATGG49366DREB DGGGCATGGCG CCGCATGG  DREB1-AFATGAACAGGAAGAAGAAAGTGCGC59362DREB1-ARTTCTCAAATCATTGCTCACT TCTTTC  DREB1-BFATGACCAGGAAGAAGAAAGTGCGC58560DREB1-BRTCATTGCTCACTTCTTTTTTCACCTTAT  DREB1-DFATGAACAGGAAGAAGAAAGTGCGC45562DREB1-DRTCCTTCCCATCAGAAGGATGTGAC  ß-actin FGTTTCCTGGAATTGCTGATCGCAT41065ß-actin RCATTATTTCATACAGCAGGCAAGC  \n              Methods\n                Assay for seed germination drought tolerance\n                  Osmotic stress was assessed based on seed germination drought resistance index (GDRI).

Germinated seeds were counted and removed daily. The number of germinated seeds was investigated on the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th days (seeds with over 1 mm length of radicle were counted). The GDRI values was calculated according to the following formula:$$ {GDRI}_i=\\frac{GIsi}{GIci}\\times 100\\% $$\n                  \n                    $$ GDRI=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^3\\mathrm{GDRI}i/3 $$\n                  \n                  \n                    $$ GI=\\left(1.00\\mathrm{nd}2+\\kern0.37em 0.75\\mathrm{nd}4+\\kern0.37em 0.50\\mathrm{nd}6+\\kern0.37em 0.25\\mathrm{nd}8\\right)/N\\times \\kern0.37em 100 $$\n                  \n                  GDRI-germination drought resistance index of seeds per reparation.\n                  GIs-germination index of seeds under stress.\n                  GIc-germination index of seeds as control.\n                  nd2, nd4, nd6, nd8 -represents the number of seeds germinated on day 2, 4, 6 and 8, respectively.\n                  N-represents the total number of seeds.\n                  Then using the membership function method in fuzzy mathematic, the average germination index of wheat under osmotic stress was calculated to evaluate the difference of osmotic stress resistance among the varieties [28, 29].$$ \\mathrm{U}\\left({\\mathrm{x}}_{\\mathrm{j}}\\right)=\\frac{\\mathrm{x}\\mathrm{j}-\\mathrm{xjmin}}{\\mathrm{x}\\mathrm{j}\\mathrm{max}-\\mathrm{xjmin}\\mathrm{j}}=1,\\kern0.5em 2,\\kern0.5em 3 $$ (1)\n                  \n                    $$ \\mathrm{U}\\left({\\mathrm{x}}_{\\mathrm{j}}\\right)=1-\\frac{\\mathrm{x}\\mathrm{j}-\\mathrm{xjmin}}{\\mathrm{x}\\mathrm{j}\\mathrm{max}-\\mathrm{xjmin}\\mathrm{j}}=1,2,3 $$ (2)\n                  \n                  \n                    $$ \\mathrm{D}={\\sum}_{j=1}^n\\left[\\mathrm{U}\\left(\\mathrm{xj}\\right)\\frac{\\left|\\mathrm{rj}\\right|}{\\sum_{j=1}^n\\left|\\mathrm{rj}\\right|}\\right]=1,2,3 $$ (3)\n                  \n                  Xj----the jth measured value of osmotic stress resistance index;\n                  Xjmax-----the maximum value of the jth osmotic stress resistance index.\n                  Xjmin------the minimum value of the jth osmotic stress resistance index.\n                  U(xj)--the membership function value of the jth index.\n                  Rj-----The correlation coefficient between the jth index and the comprehensive 106 osmotic stress resistance coefficient.\n                  Rj/<U+2009><U+2211><U+2009>nj<U+2009>=<U+2009>1rj ------As the indicator weight, indicating the importance of the jth index in all indicators.\n                  D---The evaluated value of each osmotic stress resistance indicator for each species under mannitol stress.\n                  If the measured index is positively correlated with the osmotic stress resistance of the genotypes, then formula (1) is used to calculate the membership function value, otherwise (2).

The analysis of results showed that seven genotypes (08–1783, 07–5866, 08–1826, 07–6239, Bayou 2, 34–206 and Linyou 2) belong to the level 1 osmotic stress tolerance (0.8<U+2009><<U+2009>D<U+2009><<U+2009>1), accounting for 8.75%; Sixteen belong to the level 2 osmotic stress tolerance (0.5<U+2009><<U+2009>D<U+2009><<U+2009>0.8), accounting for 20.00%; Fifteen belong to the level 3 osmotic stress tolerance (0.5<U+2009><<U+2009>D<U+2009><<U+2009>0.3), according for 18.75%; And another 46 ones belong to the level 4 osmotic stress tolerance (sensitive, 0<U+2009><<U+2009>D<U+2009><<U+2009>0.3), according for 57.50% (Fig. 2).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Distribution pattern of seed germination osmotic stress resistance of 80 spring wheat varieties and lines.

Total 13 new allele variations of TaDREB1-A1, TaDREB1-B1 and TaDREB1-D1 were found and named according to the 2005 Supplement of the Wheat Gene Catalogue [30] in the study, i.e. TaDREB1-A11, TaDREB1-A12, TaDREB1-A13, TaDREB1-A14 and TaDREB1-A15 on chromosome 2AL; TaDREB1-B11, TaDREB1-B12, TaDREB1-B13 and TaDREB1-B14 on chromosome 2BL; TaDREB1-D11, TaDREB1-D12, TaDREB1-D21 and TaDREB1-D22 on chromosome 2DL.\n                Compared with TaDREB1-A (GenBank accession number: DQ195070.1), 38 SNPs were found in the full sequence of TaDREB1-A1, the frequency of SNPs being 2.27%. Among these, 4 SNPs were observed in 5’UTR, 7 SNPs located in the first exons, 23 SNPs found in introns, and the other SNPs were found in the second exons of all alleles of TaDREB1-A1 except TaDREB1-A14. The mutation in 939 bp site is non-synonymous from hydrophobic weak glycine (G) to hydrophobic strong aspartic acid (D), while the mutations in other 3 sites are synonymous. Three base deletions were detected, among which 1 single base T is missed at position 40 bp in 5’UTR of all TaDREB1-A1 variations, and other 2 bp TT deletions occurred at position 453 bp, in introns of all TaDREB1-A1 variations except TaDREB1-A14. 3 insertions were found at position 540 bp (T), 608 bp (CTG), 629 bp (CT) in introns of all TaDREB1-A1 variations except TaDREB1-A14 (Additional file 1: Figure S1).\n                33SNPs were found in the full sequence of TaDREB1-B1, the frequency of SNPs was 4.78%. Among them, 6 SNPs were found in 5’UTR, twenty-seven SNPs were located in exons of TaDREB1-B11 and TaDREB1-B12. One T is inserted at 485 bp site of coding region. T-A, E-D, G-R, T-I, A-P, K-N, E-R, V-I, S-E, N-Q changes were found in the protein sequences. Most of the amino acid mutations were detected in TaDREB1-A13 genotypes, and the hydrophilicity is enhanced after the amino acid mutation. Lysine (k) is missed. The changes were not consistent with the osmotic stress resistance of the wheat genotypes (Additional file 2: Figure S2).\n                Two genes of TaDREB1-D existed simultaneously on D chromosome of all genotypes, named TaDREB1-D1 amplified with the primer set DREB1-D1F/R and TaDREB1-D2 amplified with the primer set DREB1-D2F/R. TaDREB1-D1 and TaDREB1-D2 had the similar nucleotide sequence except a 11 bp insertion in the former. In addition, two alleles of TaDREB1-D1 were identified, named TaDREB1-D11 and TaDREB1-D12, and also two alleles of TaDREB1-D2 were identified, named TaDREB1-D21 and TaDREB1-D22. TaDREB1-D11 had the same sequence with TaDREB1-D (GenBank accession number: DQ195068.1), while eight SNPs were detected in TaDREB1-D12, of which 6 SNPs presented at position 1205 bp (G-A), 1264 bp (C-G), 1282 bp (A-G), 1340 bp (A-G), 1429 bp(C-A) and 1490 bp (A-G), respectively. Among the SNPs, three mutations changed the amino acids from A (1.8) to A (4.4), H (-<U+2009>3.2) to R (-<U+2009>4.5) and A (1.8) to E (-<U+2009>3.5), respectively. The hydrophilicity of amino acids changed was generally enhanced. Another 2 SNPs were detected in 3’UTR of TaDREB1-D12. Moreover, TaDREB1-D21 had the same sequence with TaDREB1-D11 (DQ195068.1) except a 11 bp deletion (CCCATGCGGCG) at position of 481 bp–491 bp in intron; And TaDREB1-D22 had the same sequence with TaDREB1-D12 except a 11 bp deletion (CCCATGCGGCG) at position of 481 bp–491 bp in intron and a 3 bp (ATT) insertion at positon 1645-1647 bp in 3 ‘UTR (Additional file 3: Figure S3). However, several SNPs were found between TaDREB1-D21 and TaDREB1-D22, the same as between TaDREB1-D11 and TaDREB1-D12.\n              Expression characterization of TaDREB1-A, TaDREB1-B, and TaDREB1-D in two genotypes with different seed germination osmotic stress tolerances\n                In order to define the expression patterns of the three TaDREB1 homologues and their relationship with osmotic stress tolerance, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out to determine the expression levels of TaDREB1-A, TaDREB1-B, and TaDREB1-D in two wheat genotypes differing in seed germination osmotic stress tolerance, using the ACTIN gene as an internal control. The results showed that the transcriptions of TaDREB1-A and TaDREB1-B genes were not detected in dry seeds and seeds treated with -<U+2009>1.00 MPa mannitol for 12, 24 and 36 h via agarose gel electrophoresis. However, the expression level of TaDREB1-D had the tendency to increase gradually and then decrease when treated with -<U+2009>1.00 MPa mannitol for 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h. Higher transcript expression level was detected in seeds treated by mannitol than in dry seeds. The highest transcript expression level came from osmotic stress-resistant line 08–1783 for 24 h treatment and from osmotic stress-sensitive variety Zhangye 1 after 12 h treatment (Fig. 3).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Expression of TaDREB1 Gene in Different osmotic stress Resistance and Different osmotic stress-treated Wheat Seeds by RT-PCR.M: DL-2000 DNA marker; Lanes 1–4: lines of 08–1783 (GDRI%<U+2009>=<U+2009>55.98) (dry seeds treated with -<U+2009>1.00 MPa mannitol for 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h); Lanes 5–8:variety of Zhangye 1 (GDRI%<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.51)) (dry seeds treated with -<U+2009>1.00 MPa mannitol for 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h).\n                      \n              Discussionosmotic stress is the most significant environmental stress in agriculture worldwide, so the improvement of grain yield under water limitation is increasingly targeted in plant breeding program. Seed germination osmotic stress resistance is important for wheat cultivation, especially in seeding stage. TaDREB play an important role in response to drought stress [2]. Compared with the result studied by Wei et al. [11], much rich allelic variations were founded in our study. From the 6 genotypes tested, a total of 13 gene variations (TaDREB1-A11, TaDREB1-A12, TaDREB1-A13, TaDREB1-A14, TaDREB1-A15, TaDREB1-B11, TaDREB1-B12, TaDREB1-B13, TaDREB1-B14, TaDREB1-D11, TaDREB1-D12, TaDREB1-D21 and TaDREB1-D22) were identified, indicating that much richer allelic TaDREB1variations existed in common wheat. However, no relationship was found between the SNPs and GDRI for the time being.In addition, two TaDREB1-D genes was detected in each of the 6 wheat genotypes tested, named TaDREB1-D1 and TaDREB1-D2; And two alleles of TaDREB1-D1 (TaDREB1-D11 and TaDREB1-D12) and two alleles of TaDREB1-D2 (TaDREB1-D21 and TaDREB1-D22) were identified. It was interesting to find that TaDREB1-D21 had the same sequence with TaDREB1-D11 (DQ195068.1) except a 11 bp deletion (CCCATGCGGCG) at position of 481 bp–491 bp in intron; And TaDREB1-D22 had the same sequence with TaDREB1-D12 except a 11 bp deletion (CCCATGCGGCG) at position of 481 bp–491 bp in intron and a 3 bp (ATT) insertion at positon 1645-1647 bp in 3 ‘UTR (Additional file 3: Figure S3). However, several SNPs were found between TaDREB1-D21 and TaDREB1-D22, the same as between TaDREB1-D11 and TaDREB1-D12. The base similarity between TaDREB1-D11 and TaDREB1-D21 (or between TaDREB1-D12 and TaDREB1-D22) was higher than between the two alleles of TaDREB1-D1 (or between the two alleles of TaDREB1-D2). Besides, TaDREB1-D11 and TaDREB1-D21 always appeared together in the same genotype, so as for TaDREB1-D12 and TaDREB1-D22. The results indicated that the duplication of TaDREB1-D gene occurred after the SNP mutations, and the copy of TaDREB1-D11 and TaDREB1-D12 (TaDREB1-D21 and TaDREB1-D22) was independent in different genotypes or environments.Higher transcript expression level of TaDREB1-D presented in seeds treated with mannitol, but no transcript product detected in TaDREB1-A and TaDREB1-B, the results showed that TaDREB1-D was more important to seed germination under osmotic stress than TaDREB1-A and TaDREB1-B. There were some reports that some genes homologies to DREB1 were weakly induced by osmotic stress [10, 19, 31], so same resulit were founded in TaDREB1-A and TaDREB1-B because of no transcript product detected in agrose gel. In addition, according to the complicated function of DREB in Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, soybean, cotton and other plants [18–23] Bohnert et al. 1995 and the transcript expression character of TaDREB1-D, more work needs to clarify the function of TaDREB1-D in further experiment.When seeds were treated with -<U+2009>1.00 MPa mannitol, the time of the highest transcript expression level of TaDREB1-D presented at 24 h in the line with osmotic stress resistance, but the highest transcript expression level of TaDREB1-D presented at 12 h in the variety with osmotic stress sensitivity. If the time that the highest transcript expression level of TaDREB1-D appeare in more genotypes with different osmotic stress tolerance and relate with seed germonation tolerance under osmotic stress, it could be used as a potential marker to identify the genotypes with more seed germination drought resistance in breeding program, and then to breed the stable and high yield varieties in dry farming conditions. It is necessary to characterize genetic resources based on osmotic stress adaptation, determine suitable genotypes, and use them to improve the wheat resistance. In the germplasms tested, 7 genotypes belong to level 1 osmotic stress tolerance were identified, (08–1783, 07–5866, 08–1826, 07–6239, Bayou 2, 34–206 and Linyou 2), which can be used as the parents in wheat breeding program for seed germination osmotic stress resistance.ConclusionsIn summy, our study was intended to identify the seed germination resistance varieties, search the new allelic variation of TaDREB1, and character the transcript expression level of TaDREB1-A, TaDREB1-B and TaDREB1-D in wheat varieties or lines with different values of GDRI.The results indicated that seven genotypes belong to the level 1 osmotic stress tolerance, which might be used in wheat breeding for drought resistence; thirteen new allele variations of TaDREB1 were identified in the germplasms tested, in addition, TaDREB1-D1 and TaDREB1-D2 existed in each variety; In wheat seeds under osmotic stress, no transcript expression level of TaDREB1-A and TaDREB1-B were detected, but that of TaDREB1-D, and the capacity of osmotic stress tolerance was closely correlated with the expression level and tendency of TaDREB1-D.Abbreviations\n                ABF: \n                    ABRE binding factor\n                  AREB: \n                    ABA responsive element binding protein\n                  CBF: \n                    C-repeat binding factor\n                  CRT: \n                    C repeat\n                  CTAB: \n                    Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide\n                  DREB: \n                    Dehydration-responsive element binding\n                  GDRI: \n                    Germination drought resistance index\n                  UTR: \n                    Untranslated regions\n                  Declarations\n                Funding\n                The work was supported by grants from the Excellent Young Scientist Foundation of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University of China (2014XYQ-18) and Natural Science Foundation of China (31760382).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                The authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.\n              Authors’ contributionsML and ZW performed the experiments and wrote the paper.

In China, the ‘Red Zaosu’ (RZS) red bud mutation of the Zaosu (ZS) pear has been used as a parent in Asian pear breeding to generate new cultivars with crispy red fruit and red tender shoots resembling those of the ‘Max Red Bartlett’ (MRB) pears.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, a segregation ratio of 1:1 was observed between plants with red or green shoots in four families with RZS as the only red shoot gene donor parent, suggesting that the red shoot trait of RZS is associated with a dominant gene. Three markers, In1400–1, In1579–1 and In1579–3, were chosen from 22 pairs of indel primers targeting regions in the vicinity of the previously identified red fruit skin locus of MRB and were able to effectively distinguish the eight red shoot plants from the eight green shoot plants. Linkage analysis indicated that the genetic distance between the two marker loci (In1579–1 and In1579–3) and the red shoot locus of RZS were both 1.4 cM, while the genetic distance between the In1400–1 marker and the red shoot locus was 2.1 cM. The physical position of the red locus in RZS should be in the 368.6 kb candidate interval at the bottom of LG4.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The genetic locus responsible for the red tender shoots of RZS was located in the same interval of the red fruit skin gene of MRB, meaning that the bud mutation loci of RZS and MRB may be the same or adjacent to each other, and the red shoot trait and the red fruit skin trait in RZS may be controlled by the same, or a closely linked locus. As a result, breeders could use red shoots as a morphological marker to select for the red-skinned hybrids from RZS families.\n              KeywordsBulk segregation analysisIndel markers\n                        Pyrus; red pearBackgroundThe pear (Pyrus spp.) is one of the main fruit trees in China and a popular fruit worldwide as a result of being nourishing, delicious and juicy. Pears are usually diploid with a genome size ranging from<U+2009>~<U+2009>527 Mb [1] to ~<U+2009>600 Mb [2]. Pear skin color is either green, yellow, russet or red [3–5] with anthocyanin as the main component of red-skinned pears and the main determinant of the degree of red coloration [6, 7]. Anthocyanins contained in red-skinned pears consist of cyanidin-3-galactoside, peonidin-3-galactoside [8, 9], cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-arabinfuranoside and peonidin-3-glucoside [10, 11]. Red-skinned pears are favored by people because of their bright-colored appearance and the health benefits of anthocyanins [12–14].The ‘Max Red Bartlett’ (MRB) pear, which has red tender shoots and fruits, is a red mutant cultivar of the famous European ‘Bartlett’ pear and is often used as a parent to breed new cultivars because of the strong inheritance of its bright red fruit skin [15, 16]. The red fruit skin trait of MRB is controlled by a single dominant gene called Red, which is located in the fourth linkage group (LG) [17]. The trait of red tender shoots in MRB correlates highly with the development of red fruit skin trait and are both inherited in the progeny, enabling the early identification of red-skinned fruit by their red tender shoots [18].‘Zaosu’ (ZS) is a famous pear cultivar in China with green fruit skin and green shoots. ‘Red Zaosu’ (RZS), which has red tender shoots and fruits such as MRB, was a mutant of ZS found in Weibei, Shanxi province in China in 2004 [19]. We crossed RZS with pear cultivars that have green shoots and found that approximately half of the young seedlings had red tender shoots, indicating that the trait of red tender shoots in RZS was controlled by a dominant gene and could be inherited in its offspring. Other studies found that there might be a common mechanism of transcriptional regulation in the red fruit skin of RZS and MRB [20, 21], indicating that mutations in the same genetic locus may underlie red fruit skin and red shoot traits for RZS and MRB.In pears, most of the structural and regulatory genes responsible for anthocyanin biosynthesis have been cloned and functionally characterized [22, 23]. In the two red-blushed Asian pear cultivars ‘Meirensu’ and ‘Yunhongli No.1’, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) was found to participate in the first step of induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, while UDP-glucose: flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) was closely related to anthocyanin accumulation [7]. In another study on two other red blushed pear cultivars ‘Mantianhong’ and ‘Aoguan’, PAL was not found to be a key enzyme for colouration, while the activity of chalcone isomerase (CHI) was found to be closely related to anthocyanin biosynthesis [24].In the European pear ‘Early Red Doyenne du Comice’ and ‘Green Doyenne du Comice’, PyMADS18 was found to participate in the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis during the early stages of fruit development [25]. MYB10 interacts with transcription factors bHLH and WD40 to form an MBW transcription complex that regulate gene transcription of anthocyanin biosynthesis and, consequently, anthocyanin accumulation [26, 27]. Further studies in pears showed that the expression level of MYB10 was significantly higher in the full-red mutants (MRB and ‘Early Red Doyenne du Comice’compared) than in their green parents (‘Bartlett’ and ‘Green Doyenne du Comice’) at early stages of development [28, 29]. The demethylation and methylation of the MYB10 (PcMYB10 and PyMYB10) promoter might be associated with red-/green-skinned mutants [20, 21]. However, PcMYB10 was located on LG9, but not LG4, of the Red locus and is unlikely to be directly responsible for the mutation of MRB [28].There had been several reports regarding the transcriptomic and proteomic level describing the bud mutation mechanisms of RZS [22, 30, 31], but none have reported on the mapping of the bud mutation locus in RZS. This locus may play an important deterministic role in the red tender shoots and red fruit skin traits of RZS. In this study, we used the indel markers selected from the interval of the red fruit skin trait locus of MRB to map the red shoot trait locus of RZS using the segregation population of a cross between ‘PremP109’ and RZS. Our findings make it easier to recognize and understand the coloring mechanism of both the red traits of shoots and the red fruit skin color as well as the relationship between them.MethodsMaterials and methods\n                Plant materials\n                  Four hybrid populations were used in this study to analyze the genetic regulation of the red tender shoot trait of RZS (Table 1). The seedlings of these populations were grown in a greenhouse for the first year and then transplanted to an experimental orchard in Xinxiang, Henan Province, or in Luntai, Xingjiang Province, China. ‘PremP109’ was a blushed pear cultivar with green tender shoots bred from oriental pears ‘Kousui’ and ‘Huoba’ by the New Zealand Plant & Food Research Institute (PFR), and whose parents were (Kousui×Huoba)2 and (Kousui×Huoba)3. Eight red shoot F1 individuals and eight green shoot plants were randomly selected from the progeny of a family of ‘PremP109’<U+2009>×<U+2009>RZS cross and used to screen polymorphic primer pairs between red and green shoot plants. From the ‘PremP109’ and RZS cross, 144 progeny (72 plants with red tender shoots, and 72 with green tender shoots) were collected to be analyzed with the two parents to map the red shoot trait.Table 1\n                          Red shoot color segregation ratios in four families with ‘Red Zaosu’ as a parent\n                        Year of crossFemale parentMale parentObserved ratio (seedlings, Red:Green)<U+03C7>2(Red:Green | 1:1)2015‘PremP109’ (Red-blushed skin, green shoots)‘Red Zaosu’ (Full-red skin, red shoots)128:1062.0682015‘Korla pear’ (Red-blushed skin, green shoots)‘Red Zaosu’ (Full-red skin, red shoots)906:8055.962a2014‘Whangkeumbae’ (Ruset skin, green shoots)‘Red Zaosu’ (Full-red skin, red shoots)54:681.6072014‘Red Zaosu’ (Full-red skin, red shoots)‘Hongbaoshi’ (Red-blushed skin, green shoots)60:620.033\n                        <U+03C7>2 test for segregation: aP<U+2009><<U+2009>5%\n                      \n                DNA extraction\n                  Young leaves of two parents and 144 seedlings from the ‘PremP109’<U+2009>×<U+2009>RZS cross were collected in April 2017. The leaves were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a<U+2009>-<U+2009>80<U+2009>°C freezer. Genomic DNA of the young leaves was extracted using a combination of the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method and a centrifugal column [32]. DNA integrity and quality were detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and NanoDrop (Thermo, USA). The DNA samples were diluted to 20 ng/µL with sterile ultrapure water and stored at -<U+2009>20 °C for later use.\n                Linkage group comparison\n                  The previously published SNP and SSR high density linkage map of ‘Bayuehong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Dangshansu’ [33] was used as a reference. The LG4 of ‘Abbe Fetel’ × ‘Max Red Bartlett’, which contains the red-skinned trait loci Red [17], was aligned to the reference map by two common SSR markers. A comparison linkage map was then constructed using the MapChart software [34]. The genetic positions of two common SSR markers (CH02c02 and CH01d03) and the Red locus on LG4 of ‘Abbé Fétel’<U+2009>×<U+2009>MRB and ‘Bayuehong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Dangshansuli’ could be considered as a geometric sequence, and the genetic position of the Red locus in the genetic map of ‘Bayuehong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Dangshansu’ could be estimated according to its relative position to the two common SSR markers on the two LGs. Additionally, the physical interval of the Red locus could also be estimated according to physical positions of the SNP markers (CTG1064355 and CN900214) flanking the locus.\n                Primers selection\n                  According to the results of the linkage group comparison, the general physical interval of the Red gene was estimated, and the nearby corresponding SNP loci (CTG1064355 and CN900214) on LG4 of the ‘Bayuehong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Dangshansuli’ map were matched to the corresponding genomic intervals. The indel markers in the nearby interval of the Red gene locus were selected from the previously constructed indel marker database (http://genedenovoweb.ticp.net:81/pear/) for subsequent use. The indel database, which covers the whole pear genome, was previously developed by re-sequencing 17 red and non-red pear varieties (data not published).\n                Preliminary screening of primers\n                  Primers were preliminarily screened using 8 red shoot individuals and 8 green shoot individuals from the ‘PremP109’<U+2009>×<U+2009>RZS cross. Each sample was run in 20 µL of PCR reaction mixture containing 1× reaction buffer (Mg 2+ plus), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 U of Taq polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian), 0.3 µM each primer, and 20 ng of genomic DNA. The PCR conditions consisted of the following: pre-denaturation (98 °C for 20 s) followed by 29 cycles of denaturation (98 °C for 10 s), annealing (55 °C for 30 s), extension (72 °C for 45 s), and a final extension cycle (72 °C for 10 min).\n                Linkage analysis\n                  DNA markers were amplified from two parents and 144 hybrids using indel primers linked to the red shoot trait. According to the theory of double false test cross proposed by Weeden et al. (1994) [35] and using the JoinMap4.0 software [36], band types of all DNA markers detected in the population were classified into five types of separation modes: lm<U+2009>×<U+2009>ll, nn<U+2009>×<U+2009>np, hk<U+2009>×<U+2009>hk, ef<U+2009>×<U+2009>eg and ab × cd. Bands that did not amplify or that were unclear were marked as “--”. Red and green shoot traits were defined as phenotypic markers. The Kosambi mapping function of the JoinMap4.0 software was used to calculate genetic distance between markers and traits. A linkage map of markers and traits was drawn using the MapChart 2.30 software [34].\n                ResultsThe red shoot trait of RZS was controlled by a dominant genetic locus\n                Four families derived from crosses between RZS and a green shoot parent were used in segregation analyses (Table 1 & Fig. 1). Three of the four families showed a red: green segregation ratio that was not significantly different from a 1:1 ratio. In contrast, the ratio for the family ‘Korla pear’<U+2009>×<U+2009>RZS was not significantly different from a green: red<U+2009>=<U+2009>1:1 ratio (P<U+2009><<U+2009>5%). The 1:1 segregation ratio of the red shoot trait in three RZS families indicated that the red shoot trait in RZS was controlled by one dominant gene.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        New shoots and fruits of the parents of the four families. a: ‘Red Zaosu’, b: ‘PremP109’, c: ‘Korla pear’, d: ‘Whangkeumbae’, e: ‘Hongbaoshi’\n                      \n              Linkage group comparison\n                Results of the linkage group comparisons indicated that the SSR markers CH02c02 and CH01d03 located on the LG4 of ‘Abbé Fétel’<U+2009>×<U+2009>MRB [17] were also located on the LG4 of ‘Bayuehong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Dangshansuli’ [33]. The order and location of the two markers are similar between the two linkage groups, indicating that the two linkage groups were of the same linkage group (Fig. 2). Supposing that genetic positions of CH02c02 and CH01d03 and the Red locus on the two LGs represent a geometric sequence, the Red locus was estimated to be located at around the 57.8 cM (\\( \\frac{64.0}{44.6}\\times 40.3 \\)=57.8) on the LG4 of ‘Bayuehong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Dangshansuli’ from Fig. 2 [33], indicating that it might be located within the 51.7 cM ~<U+2009>70.3 cM interval according to the markers CTG1064355 and CN900214. Since the estimated position of the Red locus and the position of marker CN900214 were too close to resolve, we defined the region between markers CTG1064355 and Pyb04_190 as the candidate interval of the Red gene.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Comparison between Dondini’s LG4 and Wu’s LG4. The left one shows the Red locus on LG4 in Dondini’s map (2008), the middle one is the simplified LG4 of Wu’s high density genetic map (2014), the right one was part of LG4 of Wu’s map that might contain the Red locus interval we estimated. The middle and the right maps were drawed according to the supplementary data of Wu’s article, and the physical positions of the SNP markers were also added to themselves.\n                      \n              Primer selection\n                SNP loci within the 51.7 cM ~<U+2009>70.3 cM interval on the LG4 of ‘Bayuehong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Dangshansuli’ (Fig. 2) were mapped to the scaffolds where they were from according to their physical positions. Twenty-two pairs of primers from scaffolds within the interval were selected from the indel marker database (http://genedenovoweb.ticp.net:81/pear/), which was built by our team for subsequent use. The specific primer information is shown in Table 2. The nomenclature of the scaffolds used in Wu’s article and the marker database were confirmed and matched according to the file ‘Scaffold_names’ in the FTP space of the reference genome ‘Dangshansuli’.Table 2\n                        Information of 22 pairs of specific indel primers used in this study\n                      PrimerScaffoldPositionForward primerReverse primerIn1270–1NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)65,865AGAAAGGAGGAGGAGGAAGAAATCCAAGCCCTATAAACCIn1270–2NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)128,003AATAGGCCAGCATACCATAATAATGAACAATACCCATCCGIn1270–3NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)160,055ATTGCTACAAAGCTGCTCTCTATTTTGCCCTTACAGTTCGIn1270–4NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)208,561TACCTACCGGTGTCTGATTCATTGTTTTGGTTTTGTTGCTIn1270–5NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)257,130TTTTAAGGGGCAATTTATGAAACCTCCAAAAACAAACAAAIn1270–6NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)309,525AGAATTCAGAAATGGGGTTTTAATCGACATTGACACGAAAIn1270–7NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)352,640CGTGAGAGCTTACTCAGACCCTAATGTTATTGAAGCGGGTIn1270–8NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)403,691ATAGAACGGGTCTTTTTGGTTTTCATAATTTGTGGGACATTIn1270–9NW_008988270.1 (Scaffold 244.0)457,893TCTAAGGGCTGGACAGAATATTAAGTAAGGAGTCGGCAACIn1322–1NW_008988322.1 (Scaffold 297.0)125,085TTGAGGTTTCTTTTTGGTTGTTGATATAAACCAGGGGATGIn1322–2NW_008988322.1 (Scaffold 297.0)150,815TTACTGACAGCATCTGACCACAACTGGATGATTTCCTCATIn1322–3NW_008988322.1 (Scaffold 297.0)202,780GCCTTTCTGTTTGCTAGAAGATCTTCTACAACTTGCTGCCIn1322–4NW_008988322.1 (Scaffold 297.0)250,555TCTAAAAATGAAGCAGACCCCTCTTTCGATTTTCTTGTGCIn1400–1NW_008988400.1 (Scaffold370.0)161,533CAAGGACCAAAGTCACGTATTCTTCGACTTTAGGAAAAGAGTIn1400–2NW_008988400.1 (Scaffold370.0)204,789GTATTTATGGACAAGCAGGCTAACCACCCTGAGAATATGGIn1400–3NW_008988400.1 (Scaffold370.0)244,039AAAATCGTTCCTTTCATGGGAGGTTAAGCCCACTCCTATIn1400–4NW_008988400.1 (Scaffold370.0)305,894GAAATGAAAGAACGAAGGTGTTTGACTTTTCTTCTGTGGGIn1400–5NW_008988400.1 (Scaffold370.0)344,900AAGAAAAAGGGGCTTTTAGAAATCCATTCGGTACAGTCAGIn1579–1NW_008988579.1 (Scaffold545.0)23,081CATGTTACAGGTCCAACCTTCCTATTGCAATCTGAAATCCIn1579–2NW_008988579.1 (Scaffold545.0)50,472GCCCTAATTAAATGTCCTCAAGGTGAGATCACAAGTGGACIn1579–3NW_008988579.1 (Scaffold545.0)100,223TTTCGACTCTTGCTTACCTCACGAAGTGCTTTTTACCAAAIn1579–4NW_008988579.1 (Scaffold545.0)152,991GGAGTCTGGCTCATGTAATCACTTGGGCTATAGGGACACT\n              Preliminary screening of primers and linkage analysis\n                Twenty-two indel primers were used in preliminary screening of the 8 red shoot and 8 green shoot seedlings of ‘PremP109’<U+2009>×<U+2009>RZS. Three markers, In1400–1, In1579–1 and In1579–3, could distinguish red from green hybrid plants.

The black vertical bar on the right panel indicates the corresponding positions of the scaffolds on the chromosome map, and the red line on the right indicates the mapping interval for the Red locus candidate genes.\n                      \n                The Red locus in RZS was located between marker In1400–1, which was identified in scaffolds NW_008988400.1 (scaffold370.0), while markers In1579–3 and In1579–1, both belonged to NW_008988579.1 (scaffold545.0). These two scaffolds neighbored each other on the bottom of LG4. Therefore, the Red loci of RZS should be in the 368.6 kb candidate interval at the bottom of LG4, and the target candidate interval can be further divided into two subintervals: a 207.1 kb interval from 100,223 bp to 307,311 bp in scaffold NW_008988579.1, and a 161.5 kb interval from 1 bp to 161,533 bp in scaffold NW_008988400.1. It is worth noting that there is a gap between scaffolds NW_008988579.1 and NW_008988400.1 and that the size of the gap is unknown, which could change the size of the map intervals for the Red locus (Fig. 4).\n                Based on the reference pear genome, 28 gene models were predicted in the candidate 368.6<U+2009>kb genomic region (Additional file 1: TableS1). Among these, 22 have a predictive gene function. However, structural genes associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis such as PAL, CHS, CHI, DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase), ANS and UFGT or the regulatory gene MYB10 transcription factor were not found within the candidate region.\n              DiscussionChina is the origin of oriental pears and has an abundant resource of pear species and cultivars [37]. These pears include some germplasms with red-blushed fruit belonging to commonly cultivated species, such as P. pyrifolia sand pear group, P. pyrifolia white pear group, P. ussuriensis Maxim and P. Sinkiangensis Yu, although the amounts of these types of germplasms are relatively small in China [4, 5, 19, 38]. Using these germplasms, Chinese pear breeders have bred blushed pear cultivars such as ‘Hongxiangsu’ [39], ‘Yuluxiang’ [40], ‘Hanhongli’ [41] and ‘Xinli No.7’ [42]. These pear cultivars are praised by consumers due to their bright appearance, yet full-red varieties resembling European pears MRB and ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ (RCF) are relatively infrequent in oriental pears [32]. To address this, resources should be introduced for pear breeders in China to develop full-red colored Asian pear cultivars. The fruit skin color, period of fruit skin coloration and tender shoot color in RZS are similar to those in MRB. Additionally, the inheritance of the red shoot trait of RZS was also consistent with that of MRB according to the 1:1 segregation ratio in the four RZS families included in this study. The crisp RZS was very similar to the European MRB parent on their red traits, indicating that it could be a valuable genetic resource for breeding full-red colored and crisp Asian pears. This is essential because most of the offspring derived from crosses between crisp Asian pears and soft European pears produce fruits with a soft flesh texture [43, 44]. In addition, it is rare for pear trees with white flowers and red shoots to be used as ornamental fruiting plants, and RZS can also be employed to breed new ornamental cultivars displaying white flowers, red fruit and red shoots, resembling the red leaf peach variety ‘Hongyetao’ [45].The traits of red skin and red shoots are co-segregated in both RZS and MRB [15, 16, 46]. These similarities suggest that the same or a similar bud mutation is responsible for the red color traits in both RZS and MRB. RZS is a red bud mutant of ZS, a cultivar derived from a cross between the ‘Pingguoli’ pear and the ‘Shenbuzhi’ pear, which is an offspring of an unknown European pear and an unknown Asian pear. However, it is unclear whether the part of the RZS genome that is generated from the ZS mutation is derived from the genetic composition of an unknown European pear. In this study, the red shoot trait in RZS was studied by using indel markers located next to the red skin locus Red in MRB. The results showed that the genomic variation loci of RZS derived from ZS may be the same or closely linked to the variation loci of MRB that are derived from ‘Bartlett’ pear. These findings also confirmed that MRB was phenotypically very similar to RZS at a genomic level. On the other hand, these findings indicate that the red shoot trait in RZS may be controlled by the same locus as the red skin trait or by a closely linked locus. Therefore, the red shoot trait of the offspring of RZS may be used as a phenotypic marker of the red skin trait for the initial selection of red-skinned offspring.In a previous study, we performed QTL-seq analysis on red- and green- pools derived from a red hybrid population resulting from a ‘Mantianhong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Hongxiangsu’ cross and mapped the red-blushed skin trait locus of the Asian pear to the fifth linkage group [47]. Yao et al. similarly positioned the red-blushed skin trait locus of the European pear in the same interval as the Asian pear using a hybrid population resulting from a ‘Bayuehong’<U+2009>×<U+2009>‘Dangshansuli’ cross [33, 48]. This shows that Asian and European pears may share the same coloring mechanism, which results in red-blushed fruit skin. In the bud mutants with red shoots and full-red fruit skin, we demonstrated that the inheritance patterns and the loci of the red traits of RZS might be the same as those of the European pear mutant MRB [17, 18]. RCF, a full-red mutant of the European pear cultivar ‘Clapp’s Favorite’, is similar to MRB and RZS with a red fully colored fruit skin during its early fruiting period, yet unlike MRB and RZS, its shoots are green. Interestingly, our research on trait mapping a hybrid population derived from a cross of RCF and the Japanese pear cultivar ‘Mansoo’ showed that the red skin trait loci of RCF were located on LG5 (not LG4), which was similar to the trait loci of red-blushed pears but different from those of MRB and RZS (data are in submission). Taken together, the existing research indicates that red pears can be roughly divided into three sub-types: the red-blushed type, the full-red mutant with red shoots like the MRB pear, and the full-red mutant with green shoots like the RCF pear. For the two types of red mutants, further research is required to identify the differences between their mutation sites and their coloring mechanisms. Additionally, research of the color traits of their new shoots may provide a unique entry point for related works.In this study, we mapped the red shoot trait of RZS to the same region as the full-red fruit skin trait gene identified in a previous study of the MRB [17]. The candidate interval located on LG4 narrowed the search for candidate genes to a smaller range. The LG4 region contains a gap of unknown size and a known 368.6-kb region consisting of parts of the two scaffolds, NW_008988400.1 and NW_008988579.1. However, there were no structural and regulatory genes associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation were found in the known 368.6-kb region. The length of the two scaffolds (NW_008988400.1 and NW_008988579.1) were only 446,383 bp and 307,311 bp, respectively, but there were only a few markers linked to the red shoot trait gene in RZS. The lack of a large number of molecular markers tightly linked to the target gene locus indicates that the actual physical distance between the markers and the target locus is relatively far, and the gap might be much more large than the known 368.6 kb region. Although there is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase ATX2-like gene related to demethylation, found in the 368.6 kb candidate region of the Red gene in this study, that might be related to the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation according to previous studies [20, 21], it was probably not the Red gene itself due to the relatively long distance between it and the Red locus. Presently, we cannot identify more scaffolds within the gap that would further narrow the Red gene candidate region according to the high-density genetic map [33], while fine-mapping and functional identification of the Red gene requires more efforts, much more work, and a better assembly for the pear reference genome.ConclusionRed tender shoot color was controlled by a single dominant gene in four RZS families as indicated by a 1:1 (red: green) segregation ratio. Three indel markers that were strongly linked to the previously published red fruit skin gene locus of MRB were also closely linked to the red shoot locus in RZS. The locus was mapped to a 368.6 kb candidate interval (with a gap of unknown size) on LG4 of RZS. These results indicate that the bud mutation of RZS and MRB may result from the same locus or from adjacent loci, and these regions have a decisive role in the fruit skin color and shoot color. Breeders could use the red shoots as a phenotypic marker to select for the red-skinned hybrids from RZS families.NotesHuabai Xue and Suke Wang contributed equally to this work.Abbreviations\n                ANS: \n                    Anthocyanidin synthase\n                  CHI: \n                    Chalcone isomerase\n                  CHS: \n                    Chalcone synthase\n                  CTAB: \n                    Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide\n                  DFR: \n                    Dihydroflavonol 4-Reductase\n                  F3H: \n                    Flavanone 3-hydroxylas\n                  InDel: \n                    Insertion/Deletion\n                  LG: \n                    Linkage Group\n                  MRB: \n                    Max Red Bartlett\n                  PAL: \n                    Phenylalnine Ammonia Lyase\n                  PCD: \n                    programmed cell death\n                  RCF: \n                    Red Clapp’s Favorite\n                  RZS: \n                    Red Zaosu\n                  SNP: \n                    single nucleotide polymorphism\n                  UFGT: \n                    UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase\n                  ZS: \n                    Zaosu\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsWe thank Dr. Richard Volz (Hawke’s Bay Research Centre, The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited) and Dr. Lester Brewer (Motueka Research Centre, The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited) for comments on this manuscript.

To date, most of the clinical reports on CM-AVM in the literature involve samples entirely consisting of Caucasians of European and North American descent, while reports from China or East Asia are few. Here, we describe a genetic clinical report of CM-AVM. Sequencing revealed a novel stop mutation in the RASA-1 gene causing loss of function (LOF) of the RasGAP domain. To our knowledge, this is the first genetic clinical report of a CM-AVM patient in East Asia. This report may extend our understanding and support further studies of CM-AVM in East Asia.KeywordsCapillary malformation-arteriovenous malformationRASA-1 mutationRasGAPChinaEast AsiaBackgroundCapillary malformations (CMs), or Port-wine stains (PWSs), are a form of vascular anomalies that are congenital, that progressively grow with the individuals, that do not regress spontaneously and that show normal rates of endothelial cell turnover [1–3]. They manifest as erythema that is pink-red in color, and they are related to skin and cutaneous tissue, usually located in the head and nuchal area, and are observed in approximately 3–5 out of every 1000 newborns [4]. In contrast, some atypical CMs occur in cutaneous zones as multiple small, white, pale halos with central red spots that are round to oval in shape [5, 6]. Importantly, these atypical CMs are hereditary in an autosomal dominant fashion, and observation allowed their mapping to the CMC1 locus on chromosome 5q13–22 [7, 8].In 2003, Eerola et al. reported six families exhibiting this atypical CM, discovered its association with RASA-1 muatation, and defined this disorder as capillary malformation- arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) [5]. Given the localized nature of the vascular anomalies, a “second hit” hypothesis was proposed as the pathomechanism of the disorder [5, 6].In addition to the multiple spots of erythema, fast-flow lesions such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as well as hypertrophic syndromes such as Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) and Parker-Weber syndrome (PKWS) were also documented in families with a RASA-1 mutation [5, 9]. However, RASA-1 mutation was occasionally discovered in syndromes of overgrowth in length, for example, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) [9, 10].CM-AVM indicates a high risk of fast-flow lesions. In a 2003 study, 6 out of 17 families manifested with atypical CM together with fast-low lesions such as AVM, AVF or PKWS [5]. Studies in 2008 and 2010 showed that approximately one-third of CM-AVM patients possess fast-flow vascular anomalies [9, 11–13].RASA-1 encodes for Ras GTPase-activating protein 1, or p120-RasGTP-activating protein (p120-RasGAP), which is a negative regulator catalyzing the conversion of Ras to its GDP-bound form [14].Mutation of GAP may affect the function of endothelial cells, leading them to form a highly vascularized network and resulting in extensive neuronal death [15]. Stimulation of annexin A6 regulates p120-RasGAP on the plasma membrane and hence controls the activity of Ras [16]. In a murine model experiment, RASA-1+/- mice had a normal phenotype, while homozygous RASA-1-/- mice died at E10.5 from the development of vascular dysfunction and increased neuronal apoptosis [15]. In the literature, most of the RASA-1 mutations associated with CM-AVM are deletions in the reading frame, causing a frame shift and subsequent a formation of a stop codon blocking further translation of the protein. These mutations result in a truncated protein with complete loss of function (LOF) of the RasGAP domain [5].In this report, we describe two CM-AVM patients with a novel mutation in the RASA-1 gene (c.3070A<U+2009>><U+2009>T) leading to LOF of the p120-RasGAP domain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CM-AVM related to a RASA-1 mutation in East Asia.MethodsThis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine (equivalent to an institutional review board). This study was performed according to the approved guidelines and regulations. Written informed consent for study participation and publication of identifying information and images was obtained from each subject and child’s guardian prior to the study. A careful clinical record on the proband and his father was obtained by a medical geneticist and plastic surgeons.Clinical reportThe proband was a boy born at 39 weeks to a 27-year-old G1P1 mother via a eutocia. His birth weight was 3600 g, and his Apgar scores were 9 (0 mins) and 10 (5 mins). Both parents were of Chinese descent without consanguinity. In addition, no prenatal complications were noted by the parents.The proband was born with small red lesions sporadically on his right parotid area. The lesions progressively spread to his right ear region. The skin temperature of the lesion was higher than that of the adjacent normal area. His pulse was detectable with palpation on the lesion. The ears of the proband appeared to be asymmetric (Fig. 1aA). Physical examination revealed multiple spots of erythema in different areas of the body (Additional file 1). He had a large lesion extending from his right cheek to his ear and neck (Fig. 1aB-C). Additionally, there were some oval to round spots of erythema in his left arm and left knee (Fig. 1aD-E). From the family history, the proband’s father had an identical pattern of multiple spots of erythema on the neck, abdomen, back, waist, elbow and right D5 dermatome (Fig. 1aF-L). Multifocal erythema was not observed in other family members.\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Clinical Manifestations, pathology finds and MRA images of the Proband’s Family. a: A: Asymmetric appearance of the ears of the proband. B: Erythema on the head and neck of the proband. C: Erythema on the right parotid area and ear of the probandD: Erythema on the left forearm of the proband. E: Erythema on the right knee of the proband. F: Erythema on the neck of the proband’s father. G: Erythema on the back of the proband’s father. H: Erythema on the chest of the proband’s father. I: Erythema on the waist of the proband’s father. J: Erythema on the abdomen of the proband’s father. K: Erythema on the elbow of the proband’s father. L: Erythema on the right D5 dermatome of the proband’s father. b: Hypertrophy in the epidermis and small, tufted capillary malformations in the superficial dermis (100X, HE). c: Abnormal arterial networks from the ECA in his right auricular region and neck cutaneous tissue\n                    Magnetic resonance imaging (contrast-enhanced)\n                MRI was performed using a 3.0 T MRI unit (MAGNETOM Verio, Siemens, Germany) with a head and neck coil. The MRI protocol included unenhanced axial and coronal T2-weighted sequences, axial T1-weighted sequences, and contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed axial, sagittal and coronal T1-weighted sequences. The parameters for these sequences were as follows: T1-weighted spin echo (SE) sequence<U+2009>=<U+2009>620-ms repetition time (TR), 8.2-ms echo time (TE), 4-mm section thickness, 260-mm*260-mm field of view, 256*256 matrix; T2-weighted turbo-spin echo sequence<U+2009>=<U+2009>4500-ms TR, 80-ms TE, 4-mm section thickness, 260-mm*260-mm field of view, 256*256 matrix.\n                DNA extraction\n                  Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood by using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A skin biopsy was performed on the CM-AVM lesion of the proband via a standard procedure. DNA of biopsy tissues was extracted by using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) with overnight incubation in proteinase K at 56°C for approximately 14 h. A Qubit 2.0 fluorimeter (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and a Thermo NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo, Wilmington, DE, USA) were used to determine the DNA concentration and quality.\n                Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Bioinformatic analysis\n                  To target the exons as well as the corresponding boundary regions, a series of RNA baits for RASA-1 were designed and synthesized. We used the SureSelectXT kit reagents (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for the Illumina adapters. The biotinylated RNA baits were applied in hybridization reactions at 65°C for 24 h to generate the adapter-ligated DNA libraries. Then, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were used to capture the hybridized DNA targets. The target DNA was washed, eluted, and finally barcoded. An Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Thermo) was used to determine the length and integrity of the library.\n                  Quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) was applied to verify the concentration of the indexed libraries, after which the libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The resulting sequencing reads were trimmed with known adaptors, quality-checked and then mapped to a human reference genome (hg19, downloaded from http://genome.ucsc.edu) by using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA 0.5.9, http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net) with the default parameters. PCR duplicates were marked and removed by using PICARD software. Additionally, Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) was applied to conduct indel realignment, base recalibration and variant calling. The resulting .vcf files were then annotated by VEP software (http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/) and the GEMINI framework (http://gemini.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). By using Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV) software, variants were visualized and checked.\n                Sanger sequencing\n                  RASA1 exon 25 was PCR-amplified to track the c.3070A<U+2009>><U+2009>T (p.Lys1024*) variant in the blood and tissue samples from the family. Primer sequences are available upon request. Amplicon fragments were sequenced bidirectionally (forward and reverse) with the M13 primer by the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit and an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Target sequences were compared to the RASA1 reference sequence (NM_002890) using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, PA) (Additional file 2).\n                ResultsMolecular analysis of the DNA extracted from the peripheral blood of the proband and the proband’s parents confirmed that the proband’s father and the proband harbored a familial germline mutation (c.3070A<U+2009>><U+2009>T, p.Lys1024*) in the RASA-1 gene (Figs. 2 and 3). NGS analysis showed a depth of coverage for this mutation of 16,260× and 16,451× in blood samples (Table 1). This mutation was also detected in the proband’s skin lesion at a depth of coverage of 21,026× (Table 1). The score of this RASA-1 germline mutation (c.3070A<U+2009>><U+2009>T, p.Lys1024*) from the 1000 Genomes database of East Asia was -<U+2009>1, indicating that the mutation had never been reported before.\n                    \n                  Fig. 2\n                      Sanger Sequencing of the RASA-1 mutation of the DNA blood sample of the proband, the proband’s parents and DNA tissue sample of the proband.

Because of the harm of radiation, we did not perform digital subtraction angiography (DSA)on the child (Fig. 1cA-B).Pathologic Findings: Under the microscope, hyperplasia was observed in the epidermis showed hyperplasia, small tufted vessels were observed in the superficial dermis, and ectatic vessels were observed in the deep dermis (Fig. 1b, HE, 100x).DiscussionThe proband and his father were diagnosed with CM-AVM based on their clinical manifestations according to the diagnostic criteria [17]. Suspicions of CM-AVM were raised due to the multifocal cutaneous erythema observed even without the fast-flow lesions [13]. Findings of congenital and acquired skin lesions that were round to oval in shape and 1–3 cm in diameter and that had small anemic halos confirmed the disorder at the clinical level [5, 6, 18, 19]. In addition, the LOF mutation of RASA-1 enabled a definite diagnosis at the genetic level. MRI demonstrated abnormal networks from the ECA, which indicated that the patients had the potential for AVM invasion.According to the literature, CM-AVM patients have a high risk of high-flow lesions such as AVM and AVF [9, 11–13], which can affect soft tissues such as dermis, muscle and even central nervous system tissues, leading to anomalies, malformations, dysfunction or disabilities [20]. In this case, according to the results of MRI, the patient had the potential for AVM invasion. Precautions such as regular clinical follow-up and bleomycin injection should be taken to prevent AVM formation [21].RASA1 facilitates the inactivation of Ras p21 by enhancing the GTPase activity of Ras proteins [22]. LOF mutation of RASA-1 may have numerous consequences on downstream signaling, such as aberrant proliferation, angiogenesis [23] and increased ERK activation in vitro [24]. The mutation of RASA-1 in this case was the base substitution c.3070A<U+2009>><U+2009>T (p.Lys1024*, Fig. 3) present in the RasGAP domain halting further translation, leading to the LOF of the RASA1 gene.The association between the phenotype and the genotype of the RASA-1 mutation in CM-AVM is still unclear. The genotype-phenotype relationship and its mechanisms have not been well elucidated, even though there are some hypothesized mechanisms, such as changes in the expression pattern of different growth factors due to the RASA-1 mutation [5]. Another proposal is the somatic “second-hit” hypothesis, in which fast-flow lesions may form because of haploinsufficiency of the RASA-1 mutation when a specific population of cells experience complete LOF caused by a “second-hit” somatic mutation in addition to the “first-hit” germline mutation [6, 11].However, in this case, did we not detect any additional mutations on the RASA-1 gene to support the “second-hit” hypothesis, nor did we detect a somatic mutation of GNAQ, which is observed in 88% of SWS cases and 92% of apparently nonsyndromic PWS cases [25]. Thus, we can differentiate CM-AVM from nonsyndromic PWSs at the genetic level. The specific cell type harboring the mutation is not known and still requires further study.The phenotype of this CM-AVM family was discordant. The proband exhibited multifocal erythema and potential AVM invasion from the ECA, while his father exhibited multifocal erythema without any high-flow lesions. We do not know whether there was intrafamilial variability in RASA-1 mutation-related conditions in this family, and further study is needed to clarify this issue.This study emphasizes the importance of NGS, together with a careful medical history and good cooperation with the radiology department, for facilitating the discovery of new clinical findings. As plastic surgeons or dermatologists, we can easily overlook or neglect multifocal erythema and choose laser therapy as the treatment, which may lead to a great risk when the erythema is part of a CM-AVM lesion with underlying AVM. The proband will receive genetic testing; know the potential risk of fast-flow lesion formation; have regular clinical follow-ups to prevent lesion formation or obtain appropriate initial treatment; and take precautions against the life-threating complications of AVM or AVF, such as hemorrhage, congestive heart failure, and seizures [5, 11, 12, 17].ConclusionThe mutation of RASA-1 in this patient is the base substitution c.3070A<U+2009>><U+2009>T (p.Lys1024*) present in the RasGAP domain halting further translation. To our knowledge, this is the first description of this mutation in East Asia. It would be valuable to measure the Ras/MAPK activity level in vitro, such as in HUVECs from the samples collected from the patient and his father. Such information would help us understand the angiogenesis of CM-AVM, especially for patients in East Asia.NotesRen Cai, Fatao Liu, Chen Hua and Zhang Yu contributed equally to this work.Abbreviations\n                AVF: \n                    Arteriovenous Fistula\n                  AVM: \n                    Arteriovenous Malformation\n                  CM: \n                    Capillary Malformation\n                  CM-AVM: \n                    Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation\n                  ECA: \n                    External Carotid Artery\n                  KTS: \n                    Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome\n                  LOF: \n                    Loss-of-Function\n                  MRI: \n                    Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n                  PKWS: \n                    Parker-Weber Syndrome\n                  PWS: \n                    Port-Wine Stain\n                  SWS: \n                    Sturge-Weber Syndrome\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe sincerely thank the family for their participation and their noble cooperation with our clinical and laboratory work.

Clematis is also a globally important commercial group of flowers, especially in the United States and European countries. Their petals with different colors and shapes make the genus the “Queen of the Vines”. However, the genomic information and phylogeny of Clematis based on existing molecular studies are limited. In this paper, new microsatellites (SSR) markers were identified from the transcriptome data of C. finetiana obtained using the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology.\n              \n                Results\n                Sequences on a total of 71,900 high-quality unigenes with the mean length of 865 bp were produced in this study. There were 6192unigenes annotated and classified into 49 functional sub-groups in three main ontology categories in GO (Gen Ontology) database,14,022 unigenes mapped to COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) database and classified into 25 functional categories, and 21,494 unigenes obtained and divided into 128 pathways of KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes) Database. A total of 7532 SSRs were discovered from 6337 unigenes. We randomly tested 210 primer pairs, of which 52 primer pairs were able to generate specific products, and 19 possessed polymorphism in the 13 wild populations of six species from Clematis, which were used as a test material.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The dataset of C. finetiana transcriptome and the identified new SSR markers will promote genetic research and breeding effort in Clematis.\n              Keywords\n                Clematis finetiana\n              Marker development,Transcriptome sequencingSSRsBackgroundThere are about 300 species [1] in the genus Clematis L., mainly distributed in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere [2].China has abundant germplasm resources of Clematis, 147 species (49%) were distributed throughout the country, especially in the southwestern area [3]. Clematis is the largest genus in the family Ranunculaceae, consists of typically vigorous, woody, climbing vines, and is famous for its diverse flower shapes and colors [4]; hundreds of cultivars make it the “Queen of the Vines”. C. finetianais widely distributed in south China, in Zhejiang Fujian, Guangxi, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. It is exploited and used as a medicinal plant because of triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids and many other compounds present in roots and leaves [5]. C. finetiana is an evergreen species, which enhances its use in balconies and for fences. It can keep growing vigorously in hot summer conditions, which makes it different from many other cultivars and species of Clematis. C. finetiana is loved by home gardening enthusiasts for its lovely white flowers and excellent heat-resistance properties. It is a good resource for heat tolerance breeding of ornamental Clematis.Microsatellite (SSR) markers are an important tool for the evaluation of genetic diversity and differentiation between species and populations [6, 7]. This marker type has a generally good transferability between closely related species and it is a useful tool in genetic mapping as well [8–10]. Previously, only few molecular marker studies and DNA sequencing-based investigations have been reported on Clematis, including the use of ISSR primers [11], randomly amplified polymorphic DNA [12], ITS sequencing [13, 14], and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analyses of chloroplast regions accD, rps16, rpl16, trnS-trnG,atpB-rbcL, trnV-atpE and matK [15, 16]. Currently, there is a lack of SSR markers capable of effectively detecting polymorphisms in Clematis.Transcriptome sequencing has been widely used for characterizing transcriptional events in a specific tissue or during a given period. It is a very useful tool also for research on non-model species that lack sequenced genome information. The high-throughput character and low cost makes RNA-seq a good choice for genetic investigations. The data resulting from transcriptome sequencing is valuable also for molecular marker development, such as microsatellite (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. To the best of our knowledge, very few research reports are available about the application of RNA-seqin studies on Clematis [17] and no information of SSR markers in Clematis has been published. To improve precision in genetic analyses on Clematis, we developed SSR markers based on the transcriptome sequencing of C. finetiana and utilized them to investigate inter- and intraspecific diversity and differentiation and genetic relationships among Clematis samples.MethodsMaterials and methods\n                Plant materials\n                  Young leaves, stems and roots of C. finetiana were collected from three individuals. All samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately and stored at -<U+2009>80 °C until RNA extraction. Young leaves of wild Clematis germplasm of six species including112 individuals (Additional file 1) were also harvested and dried with silica gel prior to DNA extraction.\n                RNA extraction, cDNA library contraction and RNA-seq sequencing\n                  Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and concentration of RNA were assessed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel and using Nanophotometer Pearl/P360 (Implen, Munich, Germany). Equal amounts of purified RNA from different tissues were pooled together for cDNA library construction and transcriptome sequencing. TransCript cDNA sample prep kit (TransGen Biotech, China) was used for cDNA library construction. Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis were used in qualification of the cDNA library. Then the library was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq™2000(Illumina).\n                Data filtering, de novo assembly and unigene function annotation\n                  SeqPreq (https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep)and sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle) were used to remove sequencing adapters and trim low-quality sequences. After that, Trinity [18] software was used to assemble all clean high-quality reads. The expression level of transcripts was measured by RSEM, and the result was reported by units of TPM (transcripts per million).BLASTX was employed to annotate the function of unigene sequences using no redundant (Nr) protein database (NCBI), Swiss Prot database, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and InterPro database with an E-value<10-<U+2009>5. Blast2GO software was used for gene ontology (GO) annotation.\n                Real-time quantitative RT-PCR for verifying gene expression profiles\n                  The equivalent mixed RNA samples (young leaves, stems and roots) from three individuals of C. finetiana which used for transcriptome sequencing were used as three biological replicates for the qRT-PCR experiment. And 12 genes with different expression levels were randomly selected for validating the expression results of RNA-seq sequencing. Primers (Additional file 2) were designed by Primer Premier 5(http://downloads.fyxm.net/download-now-Primer-Premier-Others-Home-&-Education-101178.html) based on the selected unigene sequences. PCR reaction mixture was consisted of 7 µl ddH2O, 1 µl cDNA, 10 µl 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>SYBR® Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, VIC, Australia), and 1 µl each primer. qRT-PCR was carried out on ABI ViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) followed the cycling conditions: 95 °C for 2 min, 50 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s and 72 °C for 40 s. GAPDH [19] was used as an internal control for normalizing the expression level of the 12 genes used for qRT-PCR testing. The specific primers of GAPDH were listed in (Additional file 2). The relative expression level of the selected gene was calculated via the 2–<U+0394>Ct.\n                SSR detection and primer design\n                  SSR discovery was performed using the MISA software (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa) with the parameters (unit size-min repeats) as follows: 1–12, 2–6, 3–5, 4–5, 5–4, 6–4. Primer pairs of each detected SSR locus were designed by Primer3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3) with default parameters. A total of 210 primer pairs (Additional file 3) were randomly chosen and synthesized for the validation of SSR markers.\n                DNA extraction, validation of SSR markers and genetic analysis\n                  Total genomic DNA was extracted from dry leaf tissue of 112 wild individuals from 13 populations of six Clematis species (Additional file 1) using the E.Z.N.A Plant DNA Mini Kit Spin Protocol (Omega Bio-tek, GA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and concentration of DNA were determined by Nanophotometer Pearl/P360 (Implen, Munich, Germany).\n                PCR amplification and data analysis\n                  PCR reactions for SSR regions were carried out in 20-µl volumes by mixing the following components: 11 µl of ddH2O, 2 µl of 10× buffer, 0.4 µl of 10 mM dNTP, 0.6 µl of Dynazyme II DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 2 U/µl), 2 µl of genomic DNA (about 20 ng) and 2 µl (5 pmol/µl) of both primers. The PCR reactions were carried out with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at SSR-specific annealing temperature (Table S2) and 40 s of elongation at 72 °C, and with a final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. After amplification, the PCR products were diluted at 1:2–1:5 (depending on the concentration) with Milli-Q water. DNA fragments were analyzed using a capillary electrophoresis system Qsep 100DNA Analyzer (BiOptic, Taiwan, China) [20]. The observed numbers of alleles (Na), effective numbers of alleles (Ne), expected heterozygosities (He) and observed heterozygosities (Ho) were determined by Popgene1.32 [21]. Polymorphism information contents (PIC) were estimated by PowerMarker V3.25 [22] (Liu and Muse, 2005). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by PowerMarker V3.25 using the UPGMA method based on Nei’s (1979) genetic distances [23].\n                ResultsRNA-seq sequencing and de novo assembly\n                A total of 11.12 Gb clean bases were produced from the transcriptome sequencing of C. finetiana. 111.18 Mb (99.91%) clean reads with 97.56% Q20 and 93.66% Q30 were collected through data filtering. 71,900 unigenes were generated when all high-quality reads were assembled. The total length, mean length, N50 and GC content of these unigenes were 62,250, 865 bp, 1469 bp, and 42.35% (Table 1). The lengths of 21,676 (30.15%) unigenes were between 300 and 400 bp, 43,200 (60.08%) unigenes were between 400 and 2000 bp, 4760 (6.62%) unigenes were between 2000 and 3000, and 2264 (3.15%) unigenes were longer than 3000 bp (Fig. 1).Table 1\n                        Summary of transcriptome data for C. finetiana\n                      ItemNumber1.

Nr database was the largest matched database with 36,015 unigenes (50.09% of all unigenes) annotated, followed by the Swissprot (23,982, 33.35%), KEGG (21,494, 29.89%), COG (1022, 19.50%), and Interpro (27,004, 37.56%) database (Table 1). The Nr annotation indicated that 58% of unigenes showed high homology with e-values under 1e-30, 41% of unigenes showed very high homology with e-values under 1e-60 (Fig. 2a). The top-hit species in similarity search against the Nr database included Nelumbonucifera (14,304, 39.72%), Vitisvinifera (4652, 12.92%), Theobroma cacao (1196, 3.32%), Citrus sinensis (929, 2.58%) and others (14,923, 41.47%) (Fig. 2b).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Characteristics of homology search in C. finetiana unigenes.

Biological processes was the largest category with 12,526 unigenes, followed by cellular components (9289 unigenes) and molecular functions (7381 unigenes). The main groups within biological processes included metabolic processes (3495, 56.44%), cellular processes (2959,47.79%) and single-organism processes (2230, 36.01%). Cell (2101, 33.93%), cell parts (2101, 33.93%) and organelles (1496,24.16%) were the most frequent groups in the cellular components category. Catalytic activity (3596, 58.08%), binding (2840, 45.87%) and transporter activity (371, 5.99%) were the most frequent groups in the molecular functions category. According to the COG database, a total of 14,022unigenes were classified into 25 functional categories, which covered most life processes (Fig. 3b). General function was the biggest category with 4045 unigenes (6.85%), followed by the replication, recombination and repair category (2144, 3.63%) and the transcription category (2024, 3.43%).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Annotation of the C. finetiana transcriptome. a GO classification of unigenes.

The x-axis indicates the categories, and the y-axis indicates the number of the unigenes\n                      \n                Pathway annotations were employed to further evaluate the biological functions of the unigenes. In all, 21,494 unigenes were obtained and divided into 128 KEGG pathways (Additional file 4) which belonged to five level-1 categories, namely, cellular processes (1013, 4.71%), environmental information processing (1430, 6.65%), genetic information processing (6492, 30.20%), metabolism (13,536, 62.98) and organismal systems (1928, 8.67%). In level-2 categories, global map (5275, 24.54%), translation (2766, 12.87%), folding, sorting and degradation (1902, 8.85%), environmental adaptation (1873, 8.71%) and carbohydrate metabolism (1611, 7.50%) were the five largest categories.\n              RT-qPCR validation of gene expression profiles\n                In order to verify the reliability of the transcriptome sequencing result, 12unigenes were randomly selected and the expression levels of them were evaluated via RT-qPCR (Fig. 4). Genes with similar expression levels in RNA-Seq (such as CL6568.Contig2, CL5267.Contig1 and CL1188.Contig1) showed a little undulating expression change in the results of RT-qPCR due to the different of sensitivity and algorithms. All tested genes presented similar change trends in RNA-Seq and qPCR experiment, indicating that the results of transcriptome sequencing were reliable.\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Validation of expression levels of selected genes\n                      \n              Development and validation of SSR markers\n                In this study, MISA perl script (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa) was used to detect microsatellites in unigene sequences. A total of 7532 SSRs were recognized from 6337 unigenes (Table 2). Di-nucleotides were the most abundant type (3114, 41.34%), followed by tri-nucleotides (2594, 34.44%) hexa-nucleotides (515, 6.84%), penta-nucleotides (126, 1.67%) and tetra-nucleotides (94, 1.25%). AG/CT (2410, 37.40%) was the most abundant motif type, followed by AAG/CTT (730, 11.33%), AC/GT (453, 7.03%), ACC/GGT (387, 6.01%), AAC/GTT (348, 5.04%), ATC/ATG (320, 4.97%) and others (Fig. 5). The number of repeat motifs of SSR loci (except mono-nucleotides) ranged from 4 to 28, SSRs with six motif repeats were the most common type (1715, 26.62%), followed by five (1537, 23.68%), seven (947, 14.70%) and eight repeats (659, 10.23%) types, respectively (Additional file 5).Table 2\n                        Summary of microsatellite data of C. finetiana transcriptome\n                      ItemNumberTotal number of sequences examined71, 900Total size of examined sequences (bp)62, 250,256Total number of identified SSRs7532Number of SSR containing sequences6337Number of sequences containing more than 1 SSR961Number of SSRs present in compound formationa568\n                      aThe SSR locus containing at least 2 repeat motifs\n                    \n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Frequency distribution of SSR repeats types.

Among them, 52 (24.76%) primer pairs generated expected specific products, 38 (18.10%) primer pairs amplified PCR products much smaller or larger than the expect size, while the other 120 (57.14%) primer pairs did not amplify at all. The other five species (C. brevicaudata, C. apiifolia, C. uncinata, C. lasiandra and C. henryi) were assessed to evaluate the transferability of the 52 SSR well working markers. The results showed that 19 loci were polymorphic, and a total of 135 alleles were discovered at those 19 SSR loci among the samples including 112 accessions from 13 populations of 6 Clematis species. The allele sizes were around the predicted allele sizes (Additional file 6; Additional file 7). The allele numbers per locus (Na) rangedfrom 3 to 11 (average 7.11), the effective number of alleles (Ne) ranged from 1.80 to 9.65 (average 4.44). The ranges of expected homozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) were from 0.10 to 0.57(average 0.25) and 0.43 to 0.86 (average 0.75), respectively. The polymorphism information contents (PIC) per locus ranged from 0.41 to 0.88 (average 0.72), for the whole dataset (Additional file 8).\n                The UPGMA tree (Fig. 6) was constructed based on Nei’s genetic distances. Two main clusters were generated. Different populations from C. apiifolia, C.finetiana and C. uncinata were grouped together, respectively. C. lasiandra and C. henryi belonged to group II and the other 4 species were distributed into another bigger group I, in which C. brevicaudata and C. apiifolia were closely related, and C. uncinata and C.finetiana were grouped together.\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        Phylogenetic tree of 13 populations from 6 Clematis species based on 19 SSR loci and utilizing Nei’s genetic distances. The population abbreviations are the same as those in Additional file 1\n                      \n              DiscussionClematis cultivars are well known for their diverse flower types and colors; especially the large flowered hybrids make Clematis one of the most popular flowers. However, only few molecular marker-based approaches have been used to assist breeding of ornamental Clematis. Inter-simple sequence repeat markers (ISSR) have been used to fingerprint 32 vining cultivars and five no-vining species for assessing genetic relationships and cultivar identification [11]. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) has been used to confirm the identity of Clematis hybrids [12]. There are several earlier reports about the systematic classification and phylogeny research on Clematis, which are mainly based on phenotypic characteristics, such as the shape and length of sepals, the indumentum of filaments, the structure of pollen and plant morphology [2, 3, 24, 25]. A few reports have been published about the interspecific relationships among Clematis based on molecular markers [11, 14, 26, 27], but such research is still limited due to the lack of genomic information of Clematis. In this study, the transcriptome of C. finetiana was sequenced in order to obtain genomic data and to develop SSR markers.In the present study, a total of 71,900 unigenes was obtained via transcriptome sequencing with an average length of 865 bp. The average length of sequenced C. finetiana unigenes was longer compared to recently released transcriptome sequencing results on Eucommia ulmoides (645 bp) [28], Vigna mungo (443 bp) [29] and Prunus sibirica (652 bp) [30]. As a result of BLAST searches, a total of 38,814 unigenes (53.98%) were annotated by Nr, Swiss-Prot, COG, GO, Interpro and KEGG databases, while about 33,086 unigenes (46.02%) were not annotated by any of these six databases, thus indicating that some unigenes may be particular to Clematis. Transcriptome sequencing is also useful tool for the development of SSR markers, and there are previous reports about the development of SSRs in plants through transcriptome sequencing [31–34].Microsatelite markers are co-dominant, highly polymorphic and easily reproducible [35]. They are important tools to examine genetic diversity, the assessment of genetic relationships and population genetic structure in plants [26]. The application of SSR markers in the study of Clematis has been limited due to the expenses and time-consuming work when developing markers by traditional methods. Some other molecular marker systems have been applied to studies on Clematis. ITS sequences have been analyzed to provide molecular evidence for the identification of 14 medicinal Clematis species [14, 26]. The sequences of chloroplast DNA (atpB-rbcL spacer region, matK, trnK, trnL intron, andtrnL-trnF spacer region) and the nuclear actin I intron have been used for the analysis of phylogenetic relationships within the genus Clematis. The result showed that the taxonomic status of several species was not consistent with previous interspecific classifications based on morphology [15, 36]. However, none of them have utilized SSR markers.In this study, a high quantity of high-quality transcriptome sequences was obtained, which could be used to develop SSR markers for Clematis. A total of 7532 SSRs were recognized from 6337 unigenes. These SSRs could be divided into five categories based on the number of bases from two to six, di-nucleotides and tri-nucleotides being the most abundant types, which is in concord with previous studies [30, 37]. Furthermore, AG/CT and AAG/CTT were the most abundant motif typesamong-nucleotides and tri-nucleotides, similarly as previously reported [38]. Tetr-nucleotide and penta-nucleotide motifs of SSRs are usually less polymorphism in coding sequences region. Nevertheless, the two types were generally included in the list of screening primers [29-31]. In the present study, SSR primers of Clematis were screened for the first time. In consideration of the comprehensiveness of the experiment, a total of 210 primer pairs from all five SSR types (including tetr-nucleotide and penta- nucleotide motifs) were randomly chosen. We successfully developed 52 SSR markers, which gave clear amplification products and showed good transferability among different species of Clematis. Within the genus, 19 markers were polymorphic, and all except one of these polymorphic loci showed the presence of a high level of polymorphism with PIC values above 0.60. Several studies have indicated that tetra-nucleotide SSRs have high polymorphism rates [39]. In the present study, both two tetra-nucleotide SSRs showed high polymorphism, of then‘4–11’was the most informative tetra-nucleotide SSR with the PIC value of 0.88. Hexa-nucleotides (9, 56.25%) were the most abundant type among the 19 polymorphic SSRs, followed by tri-nucleotides (4, 21.05%) and di-nucleotides (3, 15.79%). This observation was similar to the result of SSR development in the rubber tree [40]. All amplified fragments resulting from the 19 primer pairs were around the expected size and showing that the detected polymorphism resulted from the variation in the number of SSR repeats.Microsatellite markers have been proved to be effective tool in the evaluation of interspecific genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship. The phylogenetic tree constructed based on SSR data showed that C. brevicaudata and C. apiifolia belong to the same group; C. uncinata and C.finetiana are closely related. These results are similar to those of Xie et al., who used nuclear ITS and three plastid regions in the phylogentic analyses of Clematis [13]. This result demonstrated the effectiveness in analyzing Clematis genetic relationships and confirming the potential value of the transcriptome database for the development of new SSR markers. The newly developed polymorphic SSR markers can be applied into population genetic and phylogenetic studies, species and hybrid identification, and possibly also to marker-assisted breeding in Clematis.ConclusionThe present study reported the functional characterization of transcriptome sequences of Clematis and development of new SSR markers, which are applicable to many kinds of studies in Clematis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the development and use of any kind microsatellite markers in the genus Clematis. They can be used in further studies on the genetic diversity, population genetics and phylogeography of Clematis, and they can assist the breeding of new ornamental cultivars.Abbreviations\n                COG: \n                    Clusters of Orthologous Groups\n                  GO: \n                    Gene Ontology\n                  KEGG: \n                    Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes\n                  Nr: \n                    Non-redundant\n                  SSR: \n                    Simple sequence repeat marker\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Fuqiang Cui, Helena Korpelainen, Chao Zhang, Bin Dong and Zaikang Tong for their suggestions and commenting on the paper.\n                Funding\n                This work was supported by Projects for floriculture special breeding of the Zhejiang province (2012C12909–4) and Major science projects for agriculture (floriculture) new variety breeding of the Zhejiang province (2016C02056–13-4).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n              Authors’ contributionsL-ZG, S-YB and J-MC developed the project and designed the experiments.

In order to provide basic data for selection and optimization of molecular markers of tea plants. 118 markers, including 40 EST-SSR, 40 SRAP and 38 SCoT markers were used to evaluate the genetic diversity of 50 tea plant (Camellia sinensis.) samples collected from Qinb. tea germplasm, assess population structure.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, a total of 414 alleles were obtained using 38 pairs of SCoT primers, with an average of 10.89 alleles per primer. The percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB), polymorphism information content (PIC), resolving power (Rp), effective multiplex ratio (EMR), average band informativeness (Ibav), and marker index (MI) were 96.14%, 0.79, 6.71, 10.47, 0.58, and 6.07 respectively. 338 alleles were amplified via 40 pairs of SRAP (8.45 per primer), with PPB, PIC, Rp, EMR, Ibav, and MI values of 89.35%, 0.77, 5.11, 7.55, 0.61, and 4.61, respectively. Furthermore, 320 alleles have been detected using 40 EST-SSR primers (8.00 per primer), with PPB, PIC, Rp, EMR, Ibav, and MI values of 94.06%, 0.85, 4.48, 7.53, 0.56, and 4.22 respectively. These results indicated that SCoT markers had higher efficiency.\n                Mantel test was used to analyze the genetic distance matrix generated by EST-SSRs, SRAPs and SCoTs. The results showed that the correlation between the genetic distance matrix based on EST-SSR and that based on SRAP was very small (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.01), followed by SCoT and SRAP (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.17), then by SCoT and EST-SSR (r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.19).\n                The 50 tea samples were divided into two sub-populations using STRUCTURE, Neighbor-joining (NJ) method and principal component analyses (PCA). The results produced by STRUCTURE were completely consistent with the PCA analysis. Furthermore, there is no obvious relationship between the results produced using sub-populational and geographical data.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Among the three types of markers, SCoT markers has many advantages in terms of NPB, PPB, Rp, EMR, and MI. Nevertheless, the values of PIC showed different trends, with the highest values generated with EST-SSR, followed by SCoT and SRAP. The average band informativeness showed similar trends. Correlation between genetic distances produced by three different molecular markers were very small, thus it is not recommended to use a single marker to evaluate genetic diversity and population structure. It is hence suggested that combining of different types of molecular markers should be used to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure. It also seems crucial to screen out, for each type of molecular markers, core markers of Camellia sinensis. This study revealed that genes of exotic plant varieties have been constantly integrated into the gene pool of Qinba area tea. A low level of genetic diversity was observed; this is shown by an average coefficient of genetic similarity of 0.74.\n              Keywords\n                Camellia sinensis\n              Marker efficiencyCorrelation coefficientGenetic diversityPopulation structureBackgroundEvaluation of genetic diversity and population structure has significant implications for genetic improvement in plant breeding. It has been well established that the genetic basis of biological organisms is concealed within the genome sequence, and that base-pair substitution, insertion, deletion, and other alterations can lead to genetic diversity; the diversity of organisms are manifested through phenotypic, chromosomal and proteomic differences. DNA molecular markers, having stable performance, high polymorphism and other properties, are increasingly employed in taxonomical, genetic evolutionary, breeding, and cloning studies. The use of different molecular markers and different primers for a same marker may result in amplification of distinct regions of the genome. Theoretically, higher numbers of polymorphic markers used are associated with wider amplified regions that covers the entire genome and more accurate results.EST-SSR (Expressed Sequence Tag-Simple Sequence Repeat) molecular markers have been widely used with many species and for many applications, such as genetic linkage mapping, comparative mapping, and evaluation of genetic diversity [1–5]. SRAP (Sequence related amplified polymorphism) was first used on Brassica in 2001 by Li G [6]. The genetic diversity and population structure analysis of Camellia sinensis by SRAP [7–12] have already been reported. SCoT (Start codon targeted polymorphism) marker was designed according to the Kozak sequence pattern and was developed after the discovery of the conservativeness of the initiation codon ATG (+<U+2009>1, +<U+2009>2, +<U+2009>3) flanking sequences, in which the positions +<U+2009>4, +<U+2009>7, +<U+2009>8, and<U+2009>+<U+2009>9 are occupied by nucleotides G, A, C, and C, respectively. These seven nucleotides are generally conserved. At positions -<U+2009>3, -<U+2009>6, and<U+2009>-<U+2009>9, G is the usual nucleotide. Primers can therefore be designed according to the conservativeness of the initiation sequence SCoT marker allows single primer amplification of the region between two genes. Bertrand et al. first applied this marker on Oryza sativa [13]. Lately, SCoT molecular marker has been used to access the genetic diversity of plant species such as Saccharum spontaneum L [14], Dactylis glomerata [15], Mangifera indica [16], Arachis hypogaea [17], Saccharum officinarum [18], Podocarpus macrophyllus [19] and Paeonia suffruticosa [20]. Nevertheless, no similar study has been conducted on Camellia sinensis. Tea plant is an allogamous species; theoretically, after prolonged spontaneous hybridization, the genetic background of tea plant should be increasingly complex.China is one of the main sources of tea germplasms. Currently, there are 1,100,000 ha of tea planting area, with different regions growing different types and different varieties of tea according to topographic, soil, and climatic characteristics. Xinan, Huanan, Jiangnan, and Jiangbei represent the four main districts of tea planting area in China. The Qinba area belongs to the Jiangbei district. In this research, 50 tea varieties, including those collected from different districts, common tea plant species, as well as local species in the Qinba area, were genotyped with EST-SSR, SRAP, and SCoT markers. Herein we constructed three types of molecular marker dataset which have important applications in diversity analysis, marker efficiency analysis, and correlation analysis that use these marker systems. Our study allowed the establishment of population structure, providing significant insights into the selection of molecular markers for tea plant breeding.Results and discussionMarker efficiency analysis\n                In this study, three types of molecular markers were used to differentiate tea plant accessions. A total of 1072 bands were produced using 118 primer pairs. 38 SCoT, 40 SRAP and 40 EST-SSR primers were selected for further studies according to the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB), polymorphism information content (PIC) and the degree of clear band selected markers using six selected genotypes (Table 1). A total of 414, 338, and 320 bands were obtained using SCoT, SRAP and EST-SSR markers, respectively from the 50 test materials, which included 398, 302, and 301 polymorphic bands, with PPBs of 96.13%, 89.35%, and 94.06%. Comparisons of the three types of markers are shown in Table 2. SCoT markers have a higher marker efficiency and are excellent for the appraisal of polymorphic loci, except that its polymorphic information content is lower than that of EST-SSR.Table 1\n

analysis among genetic distance matrices by three-types of marker dataset\n                Mantel tests [21] were used to measure the correlation between the genetic distance matrices generated by SCoT, SRAP and EST-SSR molecular markers. r<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.9, 0.8<U+2009>=<U+2009>r<U+2009><<U+2009>0.9, 0.7<U+2009>=<U+2009>r<U+2009><<U+2009>0.8, and r<U+2009><<U+2009>0.7 represented significant correlation, moderate correlation, weak correlation, and no correlation, respectively. In the present study, the coefficients of correlation (r) between the genetic distance matrices of SCoT and EST-SSR markers, SCoT and SRAP markers, and SRAP and EST-SSR markers were 0.19, 0.17, and 0.01, respectively (Fig. 1). Different molecular markers and different primers of the same marker all yielded distinct amplification products, which reflected the polymorphism of the genomic regions; hence, utilization of different marker designing strategies will produce different results. Theoretically, the validity of the results should improve with increasing numbers of markers and increasing coverage of the genome. Therefore, we employed three types of molecular markers to generated 1072 bands and to perform genetic constitution analyses.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        The correlation between the genetic distance matrices using Mantel tests\n                      \n              Genetic constitution analysis\n                Analysis using STRUCTURE\n                  One thousand seventy-two polymorphic bands with MAF (minor allele frequency) <<U+2009>5% were used to elucidate the population structure of the entire pool of tea germplasms. In this study, STRUCTURE 2.3.4, which applies a Bayesian clustering algorithm, was used to simulate population genetic structure based on the assumption that the 1072 loci were independent. Using a membership probability threshold of 0.60, population K values from 1 to 10 were simulated with 20 iterations for each K using 10,000 burn-in periods followed by 10,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo iterations in order to obtain an estimate of the most probable number of population. Delta K was plotted against K values; the best number of clusters was determined following the method proposed by Evanno et al. [22] and obtained via the Structure Harvester platform (http://taylor0.biology.ucla.edu/structureHarvester/). Delta K reached a maximum value at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2, suggesting that the 50 tea germplasm were best divided into two subgroups (Fig. 2).\n                        \n                      Fig. 2\n                          STRUCTURE analysis of the number of population for K. The number of subpopulations(k) was identified based on maximum likelihood and k values. The most likely value of k identified by STRUCTURE was observed at k<U+2009>=<U+2009>2. Note: Green bands: Group 1, Red bands: Group 2. The proportion of each color reflects the probability that each of the test materials (numbered from 1 to 50) belongs the corresponding group\n                        \n                UPGMA clustering\n                  A dendrogram was constructed with cluster analysis using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA), which demonstrated that the 50 genotypes could be clearly divided into 2 groups (Fig. 3). Group I included 27 varieties, and group II contained 23 varieties. The average similarity coefficient was 0.74. The two most closely related materials were 15 and 16, which have a sister line with a genetic similarity coefficient of 0.93.\n                        \n                      Fig. 3\n                          Cluster dendrogram of 50 tea genotypes constructed based on UPGMA by EST-SSR, SRAP and SCoT\n                        \n                Principal components analysis\n                  The top three principal components were used to analyze population structure. Principal component analysis was conducted under NTSYS-pc2.10e [23]. The results showed that the three PCs had contribution rates of 15.97%, 8.50% and 6.17%. PCA separated the 50 genotypes into two major groups (Fig. 4) which were consistent with the STRUCTURE and UPGMA results. GroupI consisted of 18 genotypes (Fig. 4, left), with the other 32 genotypes belonging to group II (Fig. 4, right).\n                        \n                      Fig. 4\n                          PCA plots based on the first three components\n                        \n                  The analysis performed using STRUCTURE, UPGMA and PCA yielded similar results, clustering the 50 genotypes into 2 sub-populations. Of note, PCA results had good consistency with previous results from STRUCTURE. The results generated using UPGMA were slightly different from those using STRUCTURE and PCA (Table 3) and bold numbers in group 1 by UPGMA represent the differences between the results using STRUCTURE and PCA and the results using NJ.Table 3\n                          Comparison of the clustering by STRUCTURE, PCA and UPGME\n                        Clustering methodCode of group1Code of group2STRUCTURE1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,22,40,42,43,48,492,7,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,41,44,45,46,47,50PCA1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,22,40,42,43,48,492,7,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,41,44,45,46,47,50UPGMA1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,22,25,27,32,35,37, 39,40,41, 42,43, 44,48,492,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,23,24,26,28,29,30,31,33,34,36,38,45,46,47,50\n                        Note: Bold numbers in group 1 by UPGMA method refer to the code that different from STRUCTURE and PC method\n                      \n                ConclusionsWe firstly reported the use of SCoT markers to analysis genetic diversity of tea germplasms. The results showed that SCoT markers revealed high genetic diversity among tea resources. In the future, we planed to select core SCoT markers. Different kinds of molecular markers can reveal different and complementary information of the same genome. Thus, we highly recommend using more marker types for comprehensive evaluation of genetic diversity and structure. 50 accessions were clustered into 2 sub-populations based on STRUCTURE, UPGMA and PCA; there was no obvious differences between imported and local germplasms. The genes of exotic varieties have been constantly integrated into the gene pool of Qinba tea through long-term (20–25 years) tea breeding and production activities. The selection of varieties with economic characters was emphasized during the process of breeding, resulting in the loss of some tea resources and the decrease of genetic diversity; thus, it is necessary to introduce new tea tree resources in order to broaden the genetic diversity.MethodsPlant materials\n                A total of 50 tea plant genotypes, representing most tea germplasm of the Qinba area in China, were collected from the tea experimental farm of the Hanzhong Institute of Agricultural Sciences during the 2016 growing season (Table 4).Table 4\n                        The 50 tea plant samples used for marker (EST-SSR, SRAP and SCoT) genotyping\n                      CodeNameOrigin of tea districtCodeNameOrigin of tea districtCodeNameOrigin of tea district1BeiBa13–2Jiangbei18FuDingDaBaiHuanan35ZhenBa14–5Jiangbei2BeiBa13–7Jiangbei19YunKang10Xinan36Xi14–37Jiangbei3Xi13–16Jiangbei20FuXiang3Huanan37Xi14–36Jiangbei4Ning13–6Jiangbei21XiangBoLuJiangnan38ZhenBa14–19Jiangbei5BeiBa12–1Jiangbei22FuXuan9Huanan39DaJiaoBan1Jiangbei6BeiBa12–3Jiangbei23ZhuYeQiJiangnan40WuNiuZaoJiangnan7BeiBa11–2Jiangbei24LongJingJiangnan41CuiFengJiangnan8YuSun2Jiangnan25BeiBa14–32Jiangbei42BeiBa12–4Jiangbei9BeiBa11–6Jiangbei26BeiBa14–37Jiangbei43HuangJinCha1Jiangnan10ZaoBaiJianXinan27Ning14–14-2Jiangbei44BaiHaoZaoJiangnan11JinGuanYinHuanan28Ning14–51Jiangbei45JinMuDanHuanan12ShanCha1Jiangbei29Xi14–10Jiangbei46ChunBoLuHuanan13PingYangTeZaoJiangnan30ZhenBa14–39Jiangbei47Echa1Jiangnan14DanGuiHuanan31ZhenBa14–22Jiangbei48ChunYu1Jiangnan15Ning13–3Jiangbei32Ning14–50Jiangbei49ShiFuCuiJiangbei16Xi13–10-1Jiangbei33Xi14–1Jiangbei50BeiBa14–42Jiangbei17Ning13–14Jiangbei34Xi14–50Jiangbei   \n              DNA extraction and marker genotyping\n                Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaves of each individual using the modified CTAB technique and detected with 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR was carried out as follows: 2<U+2009>×<U+2009>Taq Master Mix (7.5 µL), forward and reverse primers (1 µL each, 2 µL for SCoT primers), RNase-free water (3.5 µL), and tea genomic DNA (2 µL). In order to improve the effect of PCR amplification, changing annealing temperature was used in a PCR reaction system; the reactions were programed as follows: initial denaturation at 94.0 °C for 5 min, denaturation at 94.0 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60.0 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72.0 °C for 1 min, for a total of 10 cycles; subsequently, a total of 35 cycles of denaturation at 94.0 °C for 30 s, annealing at 35 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72.0 °C for 1 min were performed. The duration of extension was 10 min; then storage at 4.0 °C. The selected primers were synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Service Company (Shanghai, China). Initially, six germplasms (LongJing, ShanCha1, ChunBoLu, BeiBa11–6, Ning13–6, ZaoBaiJian) were used to screen markers for high polymorphim. Then, 40 pairs of clear and highly polymorphic EST-SSR and SRAP markers, and 38 paris of SCoT marker primers were selected from 154 EST-SSR pairs, 154 SRAP pairs, 125 SCoT pairs. Electrophoresis was performed using 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel under 160 V voltage; the bands were visualized via silver staining.\n              Genetic variation and marker efficiency analysis\n                Following electrophoresis, each amplification band corresponded to a primer hybridization locus and was considered as an effective molecular marker. Each polymorphic band detected by a same given primer represented an allelic mutation. In order to generate molecular data matrices, clear bands for each fragment were scored in every accession for each primer pair and recorded as 1 (presence of a fragment), 0 (absence of a fragment), and 9 (complete absence of band). Excel was used to compute the marker index (MI) of the three types of markers and the marker frequencies of the three types of markers were compared. MI values were obtained from the average band informativeness (Ibav) and the effectiveness multiplex ratio (EMR); EMR represents the number of polymorphic loci and Ibav is given by the following formula:$$ {Ib}_{av}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n\\left(1-\\left(2\\left|0.5-{P}_i\\right|\\right)\\right), $$where Pi represents the proportion of the ith sample in the amplified locus and n represents the total number of amplified loci. Using the method reported by Smith et al. [24], the value of the polymorphism information content (PIC) was calculated with the formula:$$ PIC=1-\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^n{P_i}^2-\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}\\sum \\limits_{j=i+1}^n2{P_i}^2{P_j}^2, $$where PIC represents the PIC value of the ith locus and Pij represents the frequency that allele j appears in the ith locus. The value of PIC varies from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating an absence of polymorphism at a given locus and 1 reflecting multiple alleles at a given locus. The level of polymorphism of each marker was assessed by the polymorphism information content (Botstein et al. [25]), which measures the extent of genetic variation: PIC values smaller than 0.25 indicates low levels of polymorphism associated to a locus, PIC values between 0.25 and 0.5 imply moderate levels of polymorphism, while PIC values greater than 0.5 indicate high levels of polymorphism.\n              Correlation analysis among genetic distance matrices by three-types of marker dataset\n                Mantel test was carried out with the batch file of the NTSYS-pc2.10e software.\n                Genetic constitution analysis\n                  STRUCTURE v2.3.4 was used to assess the population structure of the 50 tea genotypes with 1072 loci. The number of sub-population (K) was set from 1 to 10 based on admixture models and correlated band frequencies. Genetic similarity coefficients were computed using the SM functionality of the NTSYS-pc2.10e software, cluster analysis were conducted using the UPGMA method, and the principal component analysis using the batch file under the NTSYS-pc2.10e software.\n                Abbreviations\n                EMR: \n                    Effective multiplex ratio\n                  EST-SSR: \n                    Expressed sequence tags-Simple sequence repeats\n                  Ibav: \n                    Average band informativeness\n                  MAF: \n                    Minor allele frequency\n                  MI: \n                    Marker index\n                  NJ: \n                    Neighbor-joining\n                  PCA: \n                    Principal component analyses\n                  PIC: \n                    Polymorphism information content\n                  PPB: \n                    Percentage of polymorphic bands\n                  Rp: \n                    Resolving power\n                  SCoT: \n                    Start codon targeted polymorphism\n                  SRAP: \n                    Sequence-related amplified polymorphism\n                  UPGMA: \n                    Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean\n                  DeclarationsFundingThis study was supported by the earmarked fund for the Natural Science Basic Research Project of Shaanxi Province (2013JZ008), the Sci-technological Project of Shaanxi Province (2016KTCQ02–06) and the Qinling-Bashan Mountains Bioresources Comprehensive Development C.

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMIs) were obtained by R Bioconductor packages. Functional and enrichment analyses of selected genes were performed using DAVID database. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. The relationships among the DEGs and module in PPI network were analyzed by plug-in NetworkAnalyzer and MCODE seperately. Through the TargetScan and comparing target genes with DEGs, the miRNA-mRNA regulation network was established.\n              \n                Results\n                Totally 346 DEGs and 90 DEMIs were found to be differentially expressed. These DEGs were enriched in biological processes and KEGG pathway of inflammatory immune response. 25 genes in the PPI network were selected as hub genes. Top 10 hub genes were TYROBP, HLA-DRA, VWF, PPBP, SERPING1, HLA-DPA1, SERPINA1, KIF20A, FERMT3, HLA-E. PPI network of DEGs followed a pattern of power law network and met the characteristics of small-world network. MCODE analysis identified 4 clusters and the most significant cluster consisted of 11 nodes and 55 edges. SEPP1, CKS2, TCAP, BPI were identified as the seed genes in their own clusters, respectively. The miRNA-mRNA regulation network which was composed of 89 pairs was established. MiR-210 had the highest connectivity with 12 target genes. Among the predicted target of MiR-96, HLA-DPA1 and TYROBP were the hub genes.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Our study indicated possible differentially expressed genes and miRNA, and microRNA-mRNA negative regulatory networks in osteosarcoma by bioinformatics analysis, which may provide novel insights for unraveling pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.\n              KeywordsOsteosarcomaBioinformaticsFunctional enrichment analysisRegulatory networkBackgroundOsteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone cancer in children and adolescents, which originates from mesenchymal stem cells and exhibits osteoblastic differentiation [1]. The incidence rate of osteosarcoma is approximately one to three cases per million each year worldwide [2]. With the development of surgery and chemotherapy, the survival rate in osteosarcoma patients without distal metastasis has been largely increased [3]. However, despite improvements in osteosarcoma therapy over the last three decades, the overall survival of patients has reached a plateau and about 30–40% of the patients experience progressive metastasis within 5 years after diagnosis and die [4]. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to explore novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma.In recent years, the developments in molecular biology have provided some new insights into potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for osteosarcoma. For instance, it was found that SPARCL1 was downregulated in osteosarcoma by epigenetic methylation of promoter DNA and activating the expression of SPARCL1 could inhibit the osteosarcoma metastasis in vitro and in vivo [5]. NRP2 was reported to be up-regulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues, and associated with poor survival of osteosarcoma patients [6]. On the other hand, numerous studies shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play essential roles in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis by negatively regulating expression level of target gene. MiR-497, for instance, can activate P21 expression by inhibiting the expression of MAPK/Erk signaling pathway, and promote the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells [7]. However, the miRNA-mRNA negative regulation network in osteosarcoma had been not fully delineated by now.In this study we used bioinformatics methods to integrate miRNA and mRNA expression data, which are available in the GEO database, to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMIs) between osteosarcoma and normal cell, and establish the miRNA-mRNA negative regulation network, aiming to provide valuable information for use in defining the mechanism of pathogenesis in osteosarcoma.MethodsIdentification of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs from public microarray data\n                To explore the DEGs and DEMIs in osteosarcoma compared to normal bone, the public gene expression (GSE28424) and miRNA expression (GSE28423) profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). These profiles were deposited by Namløs HM et al. in 2011 and composed with the same cell lines: 19 OS cell lines (case group) and 4 normal bone samples (control group) [8]. Then, the dataset was analyzed by R Bioconductor packages and raw datasets were normalized based on the preprocess Core package and the DEGs and DEMIs were screened out via the limma package through the cut-off criteria of adjusted P-value<<U+2009>0.01 and |Log2(FC)|<U+2009>><U+2009>2.\n              Functional and pathway enrichment analysis\n                The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) was used to perform functional and pathway enrichment analysis. DAVID is a systematic and integrative functional annotation tools which allows investigators to unravel biological meaning behind large list of genes [9]. Gene ontology (GO) analysis including the cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF), and biological process (BP) [10] and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis [11] were carried out for the DEGs. P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 was regarded as statistical significance.\n              Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction and module analysis\n                In order to interpret the molecular mechanisms of key cellular activities in osteosarcoma, The online tool, Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database (STRING), was used to construct PPI network of the DEGs [12]. The interaction score of not <<U+2009>0.7 (high confidence score) was considered significant and the PPI was visualized.\n                The relationships among the DEGs were analyzed by plug-in NetworkAnalyzer of Cytoscape software for the characteristics of small-world network through calculating the network properties such as distribution of network node degree, distribution of the shortest path, average aggregation coefficient and proximity to the center [13]. Subsequently, the hub genes were selected according to connection degree. Moreover, Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was applied to find clusters of genes in PPI network. “Degree cutoff<U+2009>=<U+2009>2”, “node score cutoff<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.2”, “k-core<U+2009>=<U+2009>2” and “max. depth<U+2009>=<U+2009>100” were set as the cut-off criterion.\n              Prediction of miRNA targets\n                The target genes of DEMIs were predicted through the Targetscan (http://www.targetscan.org/), an online program that predicts targets of miRNAs by seeking the specific sequence complementary to the seed region of each miRNA. According to the predicted efficacy of targeting as calculated using cumulative weighted context++ scores of the sites, predicted targets are ranked. In this study, the genes with the cumulative weighted context++ scores =<U+2009>-<U+2009>0.4 were selected as target genes of each miRNA. Furthermore, we only selected the reverse pairs that contained the DEMIS and overlapping genes of DEGs. Finally, miRNA–mRNA negative regulatory network depicting interactions between miRNAs and their potential targets in osteosarcoma was visualized using Cytoscape.\n              ResultsIdentification of DEGs and DEMIs\n                Compared with normal bone samples, a total of 346 DEGs were identified in the osteosarcoma cells, which contained 43 up-regulated and 303 down-regulated genes. The top ten up-regulated and down-regulated genes are listed in Table 1. In total, 90 DEMIs were found to be differentially expressed. 58 DEMIs were downregulated and 32 DEMIs were upregulated.

The second majority of enriched categories were associated with cytosol (95 genes). In addition, the other enriched CC GO terms contained cell surface (25 genes), MHC class II protein complex (8 genes) and proteinaceous extracellular complex (18 genes). In the BP ontology, the regulation of inflammatory immune response items constitute the majority of enriched GO categories, including immune response (35 genes), innate immune response (26 genes), inflammatory response (26 genes), defense response to Gram-positive bacterium (12 genes), defense response(11 genes) and antigen processing and presentation (9 genes) and antigen processing and presentation of peptide or polysaccharide antigen via MHC class II (7 genes). The other enriched BP GO terms contained platelet degranulation (12 genes), muscle filament sliding (9 genes)and oxygen transport (6 genes). In the MF ontology, the binding-related items constitute the majority of enriched GO categories, including actin binding (17 genes), heparin binding (13 genes), heme binding (11 genes), protease binding (10 genes), collagen binding (9 genes), peptide antigen binding (7 genes) and oxygen binding (7 genes). Besides, the other enriched categories comprised items related to structural constituent of muscle (10 genes), oxygen transporter activity (6 genes) and MHC class II receptor activity (6 genes).\n                Furthermore, the KEGG pathways of DEGs mainly involved in inflammatory immune response, which included Phagosome (19 genes), Staphylococcus aureus infection (15 genes), Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (15 genes), Systemic lupus erythematosus (14 genes), Asthma (11 genes) and et al.\n              PPI network construction, module analysis and hub gene selection\n                PPI networks were constructed on the basis of STRING database and displayed in Fig. 2. We also analyzed the network properties, as shown in Fig. 3a–d. We could see the distribution of network node degrees followed a pattern of power law network in Fig. 3a, proximity to center in Fig. 3b, the average clustering coefficient in Fig. 3c and fromthe shortest path in Fig. 3d and we could also see that they meet the characteristics of small world network. When “Degree=10” was set as the cut-off criterion, 25 genes in the PPI network were selected as hub genes in osteosarcoma. Top 10 hub genes were TYROBP, HLA-DRA, VWF, PPBP, SERPING1, HLA-DPA1, SERPINA1, KIF20A, FERMT3, HLA-E, and showed in Fig. 2. These hub genes might play crucial roles in osteosarcoma.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        The protein-protein interaction network for the the differentially expressed genes and miRNA-target gene regulatory network in osteosarcoma.

Furthermore, MCODE analysis showed that each cluster contained one seed gene. SEPP1 (one of the hub genes), CKS2 (the predicted target of MiR-513c), TCAP (one of the predicted target of MiR-18a), BPI (one of the predicted target of MiR-93) were identified as the seed genes in their own clusters, respectively [Fig. 4].\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Four significant modules selected from protein-protein interaction network\n                      \n              miRNA-mRNA negative regulation network\n                Through the TargetScan, the target genes of 90 DEMIs were predicted. By comparing target genes with DEGs, we screened out 35 DEMIs (25 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNA) and 78 DEGs (67downregulated and 11 upregulated mRNA), presented an expression trend opposite to each other in osteosarcoma. And then, the miRNA-mRNA regulation network which was composed of 89 pairs was established and shown in Fig. 2. In our study, miR-9, the most significantly upregulated among these screened out DEMIS, was predicted to 2 downregulated target, including CEACAM6 and PDK4. MiR-210 was with the highest connectivity with target genes, targeting 12 differentially expressed genes (ANGPTL4, AQP1, ARHGAP25, BTG2, CD247, DNASE1L3, LYL1, P2RY8, SH2D3C, SRL, STAT5A, TNFRSF1B), that might indicate its important role in osteosarcoma. Among the predicted target of MiR-96, HLA-DPA1 and TYROBP were the hub genes. Moreover, several genes were predicted to the common targets of different miRNA. For instance, CSF1R, one of the hub genes, was predicted as the common target of miR-149 and miR-22.\n              DiscussionUnraveling the mechanisms of the initiation and development of osteosarcoma would benefit the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis evaluation. In present study, two types of microarray datasets: gene expression profile and miRNA expression profile were downloaded from the GEO and analyzed for their relationship in osteosarcoma. Compared with normal bone samples, a total of 346 DEGs were identified in the osteosarcoma cells, containing 43 up-regulated and 303 down-regulated genes. CBS (cystathionine-ß-synthase cancer), the most regulated gene in this study, was found to be upregulated in many types of tumors, such as multiple myeloma [14], colorectal cancers [15], bladder cancer [16] and et al., and downregulation of CBS help inhibit carcinogenesis. However, to our knowledge, there was no report about CBS in osteosarcoma, so it might be a novel target for the diagnosis or treatment of osteosarcoma.As was suggested by DAVID analysis, the DEGs in osteosarcoma were enriched in biological processes and KEGG pathway of inflammatory immune response. Molecular function of GO analysis showed enrichment in binding-related items. It is reasonable because immune system has significant roles in tumorigenesis. At the cancer initiation stage, the immune system can recognize tumors expressing foreign antigens and eradicate tumors via innate and adaptive immune activation [17]. If tumor cells are not eliminated via recognition by the immune system, tumor cells can enter an equilibrium phase and evolve a number of phenotypic changes and dampen immunogenicity to escape the immune surveillance [18, 19]. In other words the immune microenvironment helps cancer cells to select the dominant cells so that the tumor can progressively grow unhindered. Therefore, osteosarcoma tumors are infiltrated with immune cells that may have the ability to fight tumor cells [20] but are tolerized due to immune escape of the tumor cells [21, 22]. Cellular component of GO analysis showed the majority of enriched categories were relevant to extracellular components, such as extracellular exosome, extracellular space, extracellular region, and extracellular matrix. Tumor microenvironment has complementary effects on the development and metastasis of osteosarcoma through extracellular secretion, alteration of phenotype type of tumor cells, immune escape and providing proper acid-base environment for tumor cells [23].PPI network of DEGs illustrated the overview of their functional connections, which followed a pattern of power law network from the shortest path, average aggregation coefficient, node degree and proximity to the center and met the characteristics of small-world network, and of which 25 hub genes were selected. Most of them were enriched in inflammatory immune response and platelet degranulation. As we known, the activated degranulated platelet accumulated on the surface of tumor cell to protect them from the immune system recognization and eradication. After module analysis of the PPI network, 4 seed genes were selected, such as SEPP1, CKS2, TCAP and BPI genes.SEPP1, a major selenium transport protein, has endogenous antioxidant function through catalyzing the oxidation of glutathione by a hydrogen peroxide or phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide [24]. It was found that SEPP1 levels and activity are significantly decreased in colon tumors, human prostate tumors, C3(1)/Tag transgenic ouse tumors, and prostate cancer cell lines [25, 26]. Furthermore, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in SEPP1 that may contribute to decreased expression in colorectal adenomas and have been associated with cancer risk [27, 28]. CKS2 (Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunit 2), a cyclin-dependent kinase interacting protein, is essential for cell cycle regulation. Elevated expression of CKS2 has been demonstrated in multiple types of human malignancies. In prostate cancer, aberrant expression of CKS2 contributes to tumorigenesis by enhancing cell proliferation and inhibiting programmed cell death [29]. In a papillary thyroid carcinoma, miR-26a [30] and miR-7 [31] modulates tumor growth and tumorigenesis by targeting CKS2. In colorectal cancer cells, attenuation of CKS2 results in decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [32]. In almost the same way, aberrant expression of TCAP and BPI was in relation with multiple types of tumor. However, no study has associated these seed genes with osteosarcoma, which might indicate them as the new targets.It has been shown that miRNAs induce RNA silencing by targeting 3’-UTR of mRNAs, and that miRNA functions as oncogenes or oncosuppressor depending on the function of suppressed targets. In present study, the miRNA-mRNA regulation network which was composed of 89 pairs was established through the TargetScan and comparing target genes with DEGs, in which MiR-210 directly regulated 12 differentially expressed genes and was significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma. Mounting evidence identified MiR-210 as an oncogenic role in generating osteosarcoma; increased expression of MiR-210 is associated with decreased overall survival and progression-free survival, and more frequently occurred in osteosarcoma tissues with large tumor size, poor response to preoperative chemotherapy, and positive metastasis [33, 34]. Nonetheless, the defined roles of miR-210 in osteosarcoma malignant progression, especially the target gene of miR-210 in osteosarcoma dedifferentiation, was insufficiently researched. Only NFIC, a validated target of miR-210 from miRBase and a DEG from a gene expression profile GSE38135, had been shown to play important role in TGF-b1-induced osteosarcoma dedifferentiation and can be significantly reduced by miR-210 treatment in human osteosarcoma cell line MNNG/HOS [35]. So far, the role of other miR-210-gene pairs in osteosarcoma was not reported. HLA-DPA1 and TYROBP, the hub genes in PPI network were regulated by MiR-96, but their function were not researched in osteosarcoma too. These might imply that miRNA and their target genes may represent potential novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for osteosarcoma.The limitation in our work is that the pathogenesis of key miRNA and gene in osteosarcoma need to be elucidated through experiments in vivo and in vitro.ConclusionIn summary, our study was intended to identify key genes in osteosarcoma and construct regulatory networks between miRNA and mRNA through bioinformatics analysis. 25 hub genes and 4 seed genes were identified according to PPI network.Functional and pathway enrichment analysis indicated immune system played significant roles in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. Additionally, deregulated miRNAs such as MiR-210 and MiR-96, might exert their biological functions through their targeting mRNAs. Moreover, our results could provide novel sights in the mechanisms of the initiation and development of osteosarcoma, that would become the new diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets for osteosarcoma.Abbreviations\n                BP: \n                    Biological processes\n                  CC: \n                    Cell component\n                  DEG: \n                    Differentially expressed gene\n                  DEMI: \n                    Differentially expressed miRNAs\n                  GO: \n                    Gene ontology\n                  KEGG: \n                    Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes\n                  MF: \n                    Molecular function\n                  PPI: \n                    Protein–protein interaction\n                  STRING: \n                    Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes\n                  TCGA: \n                    The Cancer Genome Atlas\n                  Declarations\n                Funding\n                This research was supported by Science and Technology Plan of Xiamen (3502Z20154067).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                The authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.\n              Authors’ contributionsYP collected the data; LL and ZY performed the statistical analysis; JC wrote the paper; ZD conceived the study.

Moench) production in many agro-ecologies is constrained by a variety of stresses, including high levels of aluminium (Al) commonly found in acid soils. Therefore, for such soils, growing Al tolerant cultivars is imperative for high productivity.\n              \n                Methods\n                In this study, molecular markers associated with Al tolerance were identified using a mapping population developed by crossing two contrasting genotypes for this trait.\n              \n                Results\n                Four SSR (Xtxp34, Sb5_236, Sb6_34, and Sb6_342), one STS (CTG29_3b) and three ISSR (811_1400, 835_200 and 884_200) markers produced alleles that showed significant association with Al tolerance. CTG29_3b, 811_1400, Xtxp34 and Sb5_236 are located on chromosome 3 with the first two markers located close to AltSB\n                  , a locus that underlie the Al tolerance gene (SbMATE) implying that their association with Al tolerance is due to their linkage to this gene. Although CTG29_3b and 811_1400 are located closer to AltSB\n                  , Xtxp34 and Sb5_236 explained higher phenotypic variance of Al tolerance indices. Markers 835_200, 884_200, Sb6_34 and Sb6_342 are located on different chromosomes, which implies the presence of several genes involved in Al tolerance in addition to SbMATE in sorghum.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                These molecular markers have a high potential for use in breeding for Al tolerance in sorghum.\n              KeywordsAluminium toleranceMapping populationMolecular markersNet root length in aluminium\n                Sorghum bicolor\n              BackgroundSorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), is a staple cereal in many parts of Africa and Asia where it is grown mostly on small-scale, resource poor holdings. Although it is a hardy cereal, its production is significantly reduced by aluminium (Al) stress, especially in the highly leached acidic soils [1, 2]. Inhibition of root growth is the primary symptom of Al stress in plants [3, 4]. The primary consequence of Al stress is a poorly developed root system that makes the crop vulnerable to drought and limited nutrient uptake [5] and ultimately reduced crop yields [6]. In Kenya, over 70% of sorghum is produced in the western and central regions. These areas are characterized by acid soils [7] with Al percent saturation ranging from 4 to 46% [8]. Low sorghum grain yield in the country is partly attributed to acid soil stress [9] including Al toxicity. Therefore, there is the need to deploy Al tolerant sorghum cultivars in order to increase productivity.Plant tolerance to aluminium stress is based on exclusion or internal mechanisms that enable Al to be tolerated once it has entered the plant cells [10, 11]. Some plant species accumulate Al and complexed it with other substances to render it less toxic [12]. Al tolerant cultivars of sorghum and most other cereals use the Al exclusion mechanisms based mainly on secretion of organic acids, such as citrate, malate and oxalate that chelate Al outside the cells and thereby reduce its availability [13, 14]. When exposed to Al stress, tolerant sorghum varieties reportedly secrete large quantities of citric acid [14], malic acid and trans-aconitic acids [15, 16]. Aluminium-induced exudation of organic acids in plant roots is mediated by anionic channels in the plasma membrane [12]. The plant genes involved in the Al-induced acid exudation are members of the aluminium activated malate transporter (ALMT) and the multi-drug and toxin extrusion (MATE) families that encode membrane transporter proteins [14, 17, 18].Although significant progress has been made in crop improvement through phenotypic selection for Al tolerance [5, 19–21], the testing procedures may be difficult and time consuming due to the effect of genotype by environment interactions for this trait. In this regard, molecular markers based screening procedure can be more efficient than the use of morphological markers in identifying Al tolerant sorghum genotypes.Sorghum has significant genotypic variation for tolerance to Al [22, 23], which can be exploited to breed genotypes with superior tolerance to Al stress. Significant progress has been made in developing genomic tools and resources related to aluminium tolerance in sorghum, including the development of some molecular markers that can be used for marker assisted selection [14, 23–27]. However, additional work has to be done through exploring global sorghum genetic resources to identify additional genomic regions that contribute to this trait and eventually develop sets of molecular markers that can be used to efficiently breed sorghum for Al tolerance.An aluminium tolerance locus referred to as AltSB\n                 was identified through comparative mapping procedure in sorghum [24]. This locus was later found to underlie SbMATE, a MATE family gene, which encodes a protein that is responsible for citric acid exudation [14]. Causative polymorphisms that include insertions and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that were positively correlated with aluminium tolerance have been identified within this gene [27]. STS markers designated as CTG29 and M181 have been reported to be closely linked to AltSB\n                 at 0.2 cM and 0 cM, respectively [14]. However, it was not known whether the sorghum population used in this study relied on AltSB\n                 or different Al tolerance gene(s). Conserved gene order in genomic regions harboring Al tolerance loci has been reported in members of the grass family [23]. Hence, with the availability of saturated genetic maps of major cereals, it is possible to identify markers linked to Al tolerance genes in sorghum that are orthologous to Al tolerance genes in other cereal crops. The present study was conducted to identify molecular markers associated with genes/QTLs that confer tolerance to aluminium toxicity in sorghum.MethodsPlant material and the development of the mapping population\n                Two sorghum lines, Seredo and ICSR 110, were used to develop a mapping population for the identification of molecular markers associated with aluminium tolerance. Seredo is a popular but Al-sensitive commercial Kenyan sorghum with medium height and early maturity that is marketed by the Kenya Seed Company (MUSRT). ICSR 110 is an early maturing, medium height, Al-tolerant inbred line developed by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India). Seredo was used as a pollen recipient from ICSR 110 to develop the hybrid population that was advanced to F3 by selfing. The mapping population comprised 229 F2:3 progenies derived from 22 F2 plants, which in turn derived from three different F1 plants.\n                The Al tolerance of parental lines and F2:3 progenies was evaluated according to the procedures described by Magalhaes et al. [24] using the basal nutrient solution of Magnavaca et al. [28]. A concentration of 148 µM Al was used to study the effect of aluminium on root growth of the seedlings based on recommendations from previous studies [14, 23]. For this purpose, seeds were sterilized in 1% hypochlorite and germinated on paper.\n                Since individual plants in F2:3 population are not genetically identical, it was not possible to set up a separate control experiment. Hence, the following procedure was followed to determine the root growth of individual plants under a solution without Al (control solution) and under a solution containing Al, as described in Caniato et al. [23] and Ringo et al. [29]. The two solutions have the same composition except that the latter contains 148 µM Al. First, the seedlings were given a germination period of 4 days and the root length of each plant, which is referred to as initial root length under control solution (ilc), was measured. Then, the seedlings were acclimated in a control nutrient solution for 24 h (1 day) and the root length of each plant, which is referred to as final root length under control solution (flc), was measured. The seedlings were then transferred to a solution containing 148 µM Al and allowed to grow for 5 days and the root length of each plant, which is referred to as final root length under Al (flAl), was measured. Based on these measurements, the net root length of each plant under Al (NRLAl) was calculated as flAl-flc, whereas the percent relative root growth of each plant under the Al solution as compared to the growth under the control solution (%RRG) was calculated as [(flAl–flc)5d/(flc–ilc)1d ×<U+2009>5] ×<U+2009>100. The values of NRLAl and %RRG were used to classify the F2:3 progenies into tolerant or sensitive groups. Leaves were sampled from the parents, F1 and F2:3 seedlings for DNA extraction and marker analysis.\n              DNA extraction\n                Genomic DNA was extracted separately from leaf tissue of each F2:3 seedling, parent and F1 hybrid using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method, as described in Bekele et al. [30]. In total, DNA was extracted from six parental plants (three ICSR 110 and three Seredo), three F1 and 229 F2:3 plants. The DNA quality and concentration were assessed using a Nanodrop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Saveen & Werner®, Malmö, Sweden) and by ethidium bromide staining following electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel.\n              PCR amplification of ISSR, SSR and STS markers\n                Fifty (50) inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers, twenty four (24) simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer-pairs and two (2) sequence tagged site (STS) primer-pairs were tested on Al tolerant and sensitive parental lines to identify potential markers linked to Al tolerance.\n                The 50 ISSR primers were selected for screening, as they generated clear and well-separated banding pattern suitable for detecting polymorphism. The ISSR amplification reaction was performed in a total volume of 25 µl containing 1× reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.55, 16 mM (NH4)SO4, 0.01% Tween®20 and 2 mM MgCl2), 0.4 µM primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase and 10 ng of sample DNA. Amplifications were carried out using GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 1 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min and 72 °C for 18 s; and a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min.\n                The 24 SSR markers were selected based on their representation of all sorghum chromosomes and their previously reported high polymorphism. The PCR amplification of SSR loci was performed in a 25 µl reaction mixture containing 25 ng of template DNA, 1× PCR buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.55), 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20 and 2 mM MgCl2], 0.3 mM dNTPs, 0.25 µM of each primer, and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Saveen & Werner®, Sweden). The PCR reactions employed a touchdown PCR method [31] and were run using an Eppendorf® AG-22331 Thermal Cycler (Hamburg, Germany) after optimizing annealing temperatures for the individual primer-pairs. The amplification profiles consisted of initial denaturation of the template DNA at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 10 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C or 65 °C (depending on the primer-pair) for 30 s (with a decrease of 1 °C/cycle) and 72 °C for 45 s; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C or 55 °C (depending on the primer-pair) for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension for 20 min at 72 °C.\n                The two STS markers (CTG29 and M181) are tightly linked to AltSB\n                  , the locus that underlies SbMATE Al tolerance gene [14, 23]. The primers used for the amplification of these markers were those published by Caniato et al. [23]. The PCR reactions for STS markers were run in a GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) in a 20 µl reaction mixture containing 30 ng of DNA template, 1× PCR buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.55), 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20 and 2 mM MgCl2], 0.5 mM dNTPs, 1.9 mM MgCl2, 0.11 µM of each primer and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase. The PCR program consisted of an initial DNA denaturation step of 1 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C (for M181) or 57 °C (for CTG29) for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. In the case of CTG29, additional 2 mM MgCl2 was used in the reaction mixture, and 40 cycles of amplification at annealing temperature of 58 °C was used.\n              Electrophoresis, staining, visualization and polymorphism survey\n                The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide to confirm amplification and thereafter visualized and photographed using a UV photo print system (IP-215-SD) fitted with a Sony® XC-ST50CE camera (Saveen & Werner, Sweden). For both ISSR and SSR markers, the PCR products were then electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels (CleanGel 10% 52S; ETC Electrophorase-technik®, Germany) for better resolution and silver-stained, as described by Geleta and Bryngelsson [32].\n                A marker polymorphism survey of the parents was done and the markers that differentiated the two parents were used to genotype the F2:3 progenies. The F1s were included in the analysis as positive controls. Three ISSR primers, four SSR and one STS primer-pairs generated promising markers (Table 1). Two of the three selected polymorphic ISSR markers were converted to sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers as described below.Table 1\n                        List of primers/primer-pairs used to amplify markers that showed association with Al tolerance in sorghum\n                      Marker typeLocus namePrimer sequences (5' - 3')Repeat motifFragment size range (bp)Ta (°C)ISSR\n                              ISSR_811\n                              aF/R: GAG AGA GAG AGA GAG AC–140055\n                              ISSR_835\n                              aF/R: AGA GAG AGA GAG AGA GCT C–Ca. 20055\n                              ISSR_884\n                              a,iF/R: HBH ATC AGA GAG AGA GAG AG–Ca. 20055SSR\n                              Sb5_236\n                              bF: GCC AAG AGA AAC ACA AAC AAR: AGC AAT GTA TTT AGG CAA CAC A(AG)20160–20855\n                              Sb6_342\n                              bF: TGC TTG TGA GAG TGC CTC CCTR: GTG AAC CTG CTG CTT TAG TCG ATG(AC)25270–29450\n                              Sb6_34\n                              bF: AAC AGC AGT AAT GCC ACA CR: TGA CTT GGT AGA GAA CTT GTC TTC[(AC)/(CG)]15188–20855\n                              Xtxp34\n                              cF: TGG TTC GTA TCC TTC TCT ACA GR: CAT ATA CCT CCT CGT CGC TC(CT)2936555STS\n                              CTG29\n                              d,eF: ATG CAG TAT CTG CAG TAT CAT TTR: AAT CCG TCA GGT CAG CAA TC–226–22857\n                              M181\n                              d,eF: AAG GCA ACA ACT GAG GCA CTR: TCG CTA GAG TGG TGC AAG AA–169–17455\n                              CTG29_3b\n                              f,gF: TGG TGA TAT TAT TAA AAC TGT GTT AR: AAT CCG TCA GGT CAG CAA TC–20058SCAR\n                              SCAR_811\n                              hF: ACG CAA GTT CCG AGG AGA AR: GAG AGA GAG AGA GAG ACA GAG GTT GTC–111965\n                              SCAR_884\n                              hF: AGA GAG AGA GAG AGC TCA CAC AR: AGA GAG AGA GAG AGG TGT TTT A–226 and 44661\n                      aSource: University of British Columbia, Canada: http://www.scribd.com/doc/23812434/UBC\n                      bSource: Smith et al.

In this paper, these fragments are referred to as 811_1400 and 884_200, respectively. Both fragments were recovered from gels for cloning and sequencing. The 811_1400 fragment was purified from agarose gel using QIAquick®Gel extraction and purification kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified DNA was used in the subsequent cloning of the marker fragment.\n                The 884_200 fragment was not clearly resolved on agarose gel and hence the PCR products were separated on polyacrylamide gel and then recovered following the procedure described by Sanguinetti [33]. The fragments were extracted from agarose or polyacrylamide gels in 100 µl of extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton® X-100, pH 9.0) by incubation at 95 °C for 20 min. One microliter of the extracted DNA solution was used to re-amplify the target fragment using Advantage® HF2 Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the ISSR amplification procedures describe above. An aliquot of the PCR products was analysed on agarose gel to confirm amplification and the rest purified using QIAquick® PCR purification kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Germany). The purified DNA fragments were ligated into pJET1.2/blunt cloning vector following the sticky-end cloning protocol as outlined in the CloneJET™ PCR Cloning Kit instruction manual (Fermentas®, Life Sciences).\n                Transformation of chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (One Shot® TOP10-Invitrogen) was done following the manufacturer’s instructions. Single colonies of transformed cells were picked and analyzed by colony PCR using pJET1.2 primer-pairs to identify clones that carried the fragments of interest. These clones were sub-cultured in liquid Luria Bertini (LB) media containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml) for plasmid mini-preparations. Plasmid DNA was purified using QIAprep® spin miniprep kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Germany) as described by the manufacturer.\n                Plasmid DNA harbouring the inserts was digested with Bgl11 restriction endonuclease to confirm fragment size. Samples that had the desired inserts were sequenced using one of the pJET1.2 primers. The sequence quality was checked using Sequence Scanner v. 1.0 (Applied Biosystems®) and sequence alignment was done with ClustalX v. 2 [34]. The aligned sequences were manually edited using BioEdit© version 7.0 [35].\n                The sequences of the 811_1400 and 884_200 fragments were used to design new primers to amplify SCAR markers SCAR_811 and SCAR_884, respectively. Primers were designed by extending the ISSR primers so that the 3'-end of the primers contain SNPs that differentiated the tolerant and sensitive sorghum genotypes. Primer3 (an online primer designing program (http://primer3.ut.ee) was also used to design alternative primers. Different combinations of primers were tested for optimal amplification of the corresponding SCAR markers.\n                The PCR for SCAR_884 was performed in a volume of 50 µl containing 50 ng of template DNA, 1× PCR buffer, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 0.5 µM of each primer and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase. The reactions were carried out in GeneAmp® PCR System 9700 Thermal Cycler with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 61 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. The reaction mixtures and PCR conditions for SCAR_811 were similar to those of SCAR_884 except that the concentration of MgCl2 was 2 mM and the annealing temperature was 65 °C.\n              Data scoring and statistical analysis\n                The bands for ISSR, STS and SCAR markers were scored as present (1) or absent (0) whereas the SSR marker fragments were scored as either parental allele (A or B),or heterozygous for both alleles (AB). All phenotypic data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS® and means were separated using Tukey’s test at 5% significance level. The association of individual marker with Al tolerance was tested with one-way analysis of variance and linear regression analysis, with a threshold significance level of P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05. When a significant difference was found between the genotypic groups, a pairwise comparison was made using Tukey’s test. For those markers that showed significant association with aluminium tolerance when analyzed individually, multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to check for collinearity between the markers. The Chi-square goodness-of-fit test for the Mendelian segregation of the alleles of each marker was also conducted for the F2:3 population (Table 2).Table 2\n                        Simple and multiple linear regression analysis of 229 F2:3 progeny plants for the association between marker-based genotypes and net root length in aluminium (NRLAl) and percent relative root growth (%RRG); and Chi-square goodness- of-fit test for Mendelian segregation of the markers\n                      MarkerdChromosome numberdMarker position (bp range)NRLAl%RRG<U+03C7> 2 test   FP-valueR2FP-valueR2<U+03C7>2P-value\n                              Sb5_236\n                            352,278,272–52,278,44515.080.0000.11011.920.0010.0505.330.070Xtxp34369,704,047–69,704,41118.750.0000.14217.070.0000.0703.940.139\n                              CTG29_3b\n                            370,939,651–70,939,83411.420.0010.0489.490.0020.0403.600.059\n                              811_1400\n                              a371,473,923–71,475,31824.880.0000.1009.780.0020.0410.140.709\n                              884_200\n                              b642,689,435–42,689,5554.640.0320.0175.070.0250.0253.090.079\n                              Sb6_342\n                            738,823,193–38,823,4784.490.0120.0386.060.0150.0300.360.837\n                              Sb6_34\n                            861,802,592–61,802,7957.580.0010.0634.020.0460.0205.700.058\n                              835_200\n                            1056,491,522–56,491,7023.610.0490.0166.850.0090.0291.500.220Four markersc3 15.670.0000.2197.060.0000.119  All markers  8.150.0000.2513.820.0000.122  \n                      aCcorresponds to SCAR_811; bcorresponds to SCAR_884; cthe four markers on chromosome 3. dThe chromosome number and the position of the markers within the corresponding chromosomes (in bp range) were identified through BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) search of the sequences of the markers against the sorghum genome. The GenBank Accession number of chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 8 and 10 are NC_012872.2, NC_012875.2, NC_012876.2, NC_012877.2, NC_012879.2, respectively. Note: the position of SbMATE gene on chromosome 3 (NC_012872.2) is 71,105,461–71,108,054 bp\n                    \n              ResultsResponse of parental lines and their progenies to aluminium stress\n                The root growth in the two parental sorghum lines, Seredo and ICSR 110, exhibited significantly different responses (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) to the Al stress at 148 µM Al (Figs. 1 and 2). ICSR 110 was tolerant with only 15% reduction in root growth, whereas Seredo had 53% reduction in root growth. The net root growth in aluminium and percentage of relative root growth were strongly correlated (r2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.70). Based on the variation in net growth of the sensitive parent, the F2:3 progeny plants with net root growth of 4.0 cm or less were classified as sensitive. Those that had net root growth ranging between 4.0 cm and 5.0 cm were classified as moderately tolerant, while progeny plants with a net root growth above 5.0 cm were classified as tolerant to Al stress. Based on this criterion, among the 229 F2:3 population, 98, 58 and 73 individuals were tolerant, moderately tolerant and sensitive, respectively.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Frequency distribution of NRLAl of 229 F2:3 progeny derived from a cross between Seredo, an aluminium sensitive sorghum line, and ICSR 110, an aluminium tolerant line. The NRLAl mean values for Seredo and ICSR 110 were 3.8 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>40) and 6.0 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>40), respectively as shown by the arrows\n                      \n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Frequency distribution of %RRG of 229 F2:3 progeny derived from a cross between Seredo, an aluminium sensitive sorghum line, and ICSR 110, an aluminium tolerant line. The %RRGs of the parental lines are shown by the arrows for comparison\n                      \n              The molecular markers associated with tolerance to Aluminium toxicity\n                Ten of the fifty ISSR primers amplified fragments that were polymorphic between the two parental lines. Preliminary analysis of the ten polymorphic markers using 21 Al tolerant and 21 Al sensitive F2:3 progeny revealed that ISSR_811, ISSR_835 and ISSR_884 primers amplified three fragments of approximately 1400 bp, 200 bp and 200 bp, respectively, having uneven distribution among aluminium tolerant and sensitive progenies. After genotyping, the remaining 187 F2:3 progeny plants were genotyped with these primers. The analysis of phenotypic and genotypic data from the 229 F2:3 progeny revealed significant association of these markers with tolerance to Al toxicity (Table 2). The 811_1400 fragment was specific to Seredo and found in most Al sensitive progeny. On the other hand, the 835_200 and 884_200 amplified fragments showed significant association with aluminium tolerance.\n                Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to search the GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and the Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) databases to locate the genomic positions of these markers within the sorghum genome. The BLAST searching of 811_1400 marker sequence in the Gramene database resulted in a sorghum sequence that share 1386 bp (with 99.6% sequence identity) with 811_1400 on chromosome 3 at position 71,512,250–71,513,635 bp. The corresponding position of this marker on sorghum chromosome 3 (GenBank accession number NC_012872.2) is 71,473,923–71,475,318 bp (Table 2).\n                Two sequences that shared 116 bp and 115 bp (both with 100% sequence identity) with 884_200 were found through BLAST searching of Gramene database. These sequences are located on chromosome 6 at positions 42,646,793–42,646,908 bp and 42,646,902–42,647,016 bp, respectively, and the two sequences together cover the whole sequence of the marker 884_200. These sequences have an overlapping sequence with a gene, Sb06g015330, that codes for putative uncharacterized protein Sb06g015330 (source: UniProtKB/TrEMBL; Acc: C5YFS2_SORBI; cited at http://www.gramene.org). The corresponding position of marker 884_200 on sorghum chromosome 6 (GenBank accession number NC_012875.2) is 42,689,435–42,689,555 bp (Table 2). Similarly, two sequences that shared 155 bp and 72 bp (with 92.9 and 98.6% sequence identity, respectively) with 835_200 were found through BLAST searching of Gramene database. These sequences are located on chromosome 10 at position 56,232,617–56,232,771 bp and 56,232,771–56,232,842 bp, respectively. The corresponding position of marker 835_200 on sorghum chromosome 10 (GenBank accession number NC_012879.2) is 56,491,522–56,491,702 bp (Table 2). Hence, markers 811_1400, 884_200 and 835_200 are located on chromosomes 3, 6 and 10, respectively. Of these markers, 811_1400 and 884_200 were converted into SCAR markers SCAR_811 and SCAR_884, respectively.\n                The first attempt to develop SCAR marker based on the sequence of 811_1400 fragment was by using forward and reverse primers that were developed through extending the sequence of ISSR_811 primer. These primers amplified fragments of the same size in both parents and their progeny. DNA sequencing of the fragments from tolerant and sensitive parents revealed two SNP sites that differentiate the parents (Table 3). One of these SNPs was targeted to design the forward primer in order to get amplified product specific to the sensitive parent, Seredo. The use of a forward primer that included the SNP site and a reverse primer that was designed by extending the ISSR_811 primer resulted in the development of a polymorphic marker, SCAR_811. Fig. 3 shows the SCAR_811 marker segregation in the F2:3 progeny and parents. The Chi-square goodness-of-fit test showed Mendelian segregation of this marker among the F2:3 progeny (<U+03C7>2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.14; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.71; Table 2). The sensitive parental line and most of the sensitive F2:3 progeny bear SCAR_811 whereas the marker is absent in the tolerant parent ICSR 110 and most of the tolerant progeny showing the association between the SCAR_811 marker and tolerance to Al toxicity. This marker explained 10% of the variation in NRLAl (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.10; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001) and 4% of %RRG (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04; P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) in the F2:3 progeny (Table 2).Table 3\n                        Partial DNA sequences of ICSR 110 and Seredo parental lines sequenced by primers designed based on the DNA sequence of 811_1400 marker that was amplified in Seredo but not in ICSR 110\n                      PLDNA sequence1a\n                              A\n                            AAATAGCAGTATTTAAGGACGGAGGGAGTAGCTATTGACCGGATGGATTCA\n                              G\n                            AC2b\n                              G\n                            AAATAGCAGTATTTAAGGACGGAGGGAGTAGCTATTGACCGGATGGATTCA\n                              A\n                            AC\n                      PL parental line, 1a\n                         ICSR 110; 2b\n                         Seredo\n                      There are two variable sites that differentiated the two parents as indicated in bold\n                    \n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Segregation of SCAR_811 marker in aluminium tolerant (lanes 4–18) and sensitive (lanes 22–35) F2:3 progeny. The F1s are on lanes 19–21 and the parental lines Seredo and ICSR 110 are on lanes 1–3 and 36–38, respectively\n                      \n                The primers for SCAR_884 were developed by excluding the first three nucleotides at the 5'-end of ISSR_884 primer and extending the sequence at the 3'-end. The 884_200 fragment was specific to ICSR 110 parental line. However, the newly designed SCAR_884 primer-pairs amplified fragments both in Seredo and ICSR 110 but of different fragment sizes. Sequencing of these fragments revealed that the fragment from Seredo had a 220 bp insertion. All F1 individuals produced from the Seredo x ICSR 110 crosses had both fragments and hence the SCAR_884 marker is co-dominant and can be used to differentiate homozygotes and heterozygotes at this locus. This marker showed significant association with Al tolerance (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) when analyzed using both NRLAl (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.017) and %RRG (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.025) indices.\n                Analysis of the parental lines and some of their F2:3 progeny using STS markers M181 and CTG29 produced fragments of the same size for each marker, and could not be used to differentiate the tolerant and sensitive lines. Hence, the PCR products of the parental lines as well as five most tolerant and four most sensitive F2:3 progeny were sequenced for both markers in an attempt to identify useful sequence variation. The DNA sequences of marker M181 were identical for all genotypes sequenced whereas a two base pair indel (GA/-) that differentiated the sensitive and tolerant parents was observed in the case of CTG29 (Table 4). Based on these sequences, a new dominant marker, designated as CTG29_3b (Table 2), was developed by designing a new forward primer that included the indel sequence. The CTG29_3b marker amplified by this forward primer and the CTG29 reverse primer was present in ICSR 110 and most tolerant F2:3 progeny and absent in Seredo and most sensitive F2:3 progeny. The association of this marker with Al tolerance when analyzed based on NRLAl (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.048) and %RRG (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.040) is significant (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.005) (Table 2).Table 4\n                        Partial DNA sequence of STS locus CTG29 showing indels that differentiated the aluminium tolerant F2:3 progenies (15r, 15A2, 21a, 15 m, 21 h, 15v and 42c) and parental line ICSR 110 from aluminium sensitive F2:3 progeny (60f, 59a, 689, 693) and parental line Seredo\n                      Sample codeDNA sequence15rATATTATTAAAACTGTGTGATATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC15A2ATATTATTAAAACTGTGTGATATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC21aATATTATTAAAACTGTGTGATATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC15 mATATTATTAAAACTGTGTGATATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC21 hATATTATTAAAACTGTGTGATATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC15vATATTATTAAAACTGTGTGATATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC42cATATTATTAAAACTGTGTGATATAGCGTGAGCGTGGACICSR-110ATATTATTAAAACTGTGTGATATAGCGTGAGCGTGGACSeredoATATTATTAAAACTGTGT––TATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC60fATATTATTAAAACTGTGT––TATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC59aATATTATTAAAACTGTGT––TATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC689ATATTATTAAAACTGTGT––TATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC693ATATTATTAAAACTGTGT––TATAGCGTGAGCGTGGAC\n                The BLAST searching of CTG29-3b sequence against the sorghum genome sequence at http://www.gramene.org identified a sequence that share 177 bp (with 100% sequence similarity) with CTG29-3b at position 70,979,101–70,979,277 bp on chromosome 3, in agreement with previous reports [23, 24]. The corresponding position of this marker on sorghum chromosome 3 (GenBank accession number NC_012872.2) is 70,939,651–70,939,834 bp (Table 2). Overall, single marker analysis revealed that the mean net root length of the different genotypic groups for each of the four dominant markers (811_1400, 835_200, 884_200, CTG29_3b) was significantly different (Fig. 4).\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Net root length of sorghum F2:3 progeny grown in the presence of 148 µM aluminium based on the different genotypic classes for four dominant markers (811_1400, 835_200, CTG29_3b and 884_200). For each locus, genotypes with different letters indicated on top of the bars were significantly different from each other in their tolerance to Al toxicity. The error bars represent standard error values\n                      \n                In the case of SSR, polymorphism was detected in nine out of the 24 loci analyzed for the parents. Data analysis based on the 229 F2:3 progeny together with the parental lines revealed that markers from four of the nine loci (Xtxp34, Sb6_34, Sb5_236 and Sb6_342) showed significant association with both NRLAl and %RRG (Table 2; Fig. 5). The mean net root growth of the different genotypic classes, especially the homozygous classes were significantly different (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05; Fig. 5). For marker Xtxp34, the mean net root lengths of the three genotypic classes were distinctly different (Fig. 5). For markers Sb6_342 and Sb6_34, the heterozygous classes (AB) had mean net root lengths that were intermediate between the homozygous classes and were not significantly different from both homozygous parents (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). Whereas the heterozygous class in marker Sb5_236 had mean net root length that was similar to net root length of the B homozygous class. The NRLAl phenotypic variance (R2 values) explained by these SSR markers were 14% for Xtxp34, 6% for Sb6_34, 11% for Sb5_236 and 4% Sb6_342. For %RRG, these values are 7, 2, 5 and 3%, respectively (Table 2). The four markers on chromosome 3 (811_1400, CTG29_3b, Xtxp34 and Sb5_236) together explained 22% of the variation in NRLAl and 12% of the variation in %RRG (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001). The order of these markers on chromosome 3 (accession number NC_012872.2) is Sb5_236, Xtxp34, CTG29_3b and 811_1400 with 17,426 kbp, 1235 kbp and 532 kbp between them in that order (Fig. 6). The closest marker to the SbMATE gene is CTG29_3b with 166 kbp between them. Overall, the eight markers explained 25% of the variation in NRLAl and 12% of the variation in %RRG (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001).\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Net root length of sorghum F2:3 progeny grown in the presence of 148 µM aluminium based on the different genotypic classes of four codominant markers (Xtxp34, Sb6_342, Sb6_34 and Sb5_236).

In rye, three AFLP markers [36] that are linked to gene Alt3 and two RAPD markers that were converted to SCAR markers [37], flank Alt1 gene. In maize, RFLP and SSR markers linked to Al tolerance QTLs have been reported [38]. Raman et al. [39] identified AFLP and microsatellite markers linked to the aluminium tolerance gene located on chromosome 4H in barley. The identification of molecular markers linked to Al tolerance in sorghum through genetic linkage, QTL and association mapping can accelerate the development of high yielding varieties that can withstand Al stress [14, 23–27]. Three ISSR (811_1400, 835_200 and 884_200), one STS (CTG29_3b) and four SSR (Xtxp34, Sb6_34, Sb5_236 and Sb6_342) markers showed significant association with aluminium tolerance in this study. Four of these markers (811_1400, CTG29_3b, Xtxp34 and Sb5_236) are located on chromosome 3 whereas markers 884_200, Sb6_342, Sb6_34 and 835_200 are located on chromosomes 6, 7, 8 and 10, respectively.Genes that regulate Al tolerance in plants are shown to have different mode of actions. In rice, two genes that were referred to as sensitive to Al rhizotoxicity1 and 2 (STAR1 and STAR2) were reported to function as an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter and have significant contribution in Al tolerance [40]. Yamaji et al. [41] reported a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor, Al resistance transcription factor 1 (ART1), which regulates the expression of genes related to Al tolerance in rice, including STAR1 and STAR2. In line with these studies, the present study suggests the involvement of several genes in regulating Al tolerance in sorghum, as the markers that showed significant association with Al tolerance are located on five different chromosomes.To date, only one Al tolerance locus, AltSB\n                , which underlies the SbMATE gene in sorghum, has been identified and mapped to the terminal region of chromosome 3 and characterized in detail [14, 24, 27]. The SbMATE gene, codes for aluminium-activated citrate transporter that is highly expressed in root apices of aluminium-tolerant sorghum lines [14]. Caniato et al. [27] developed functional markers within the SbMATE gene that can be used for marker assisted selection for aluminium tolerance. In this study, two STS markers CTG29 and M181 that are located at 0.2 cM and 0 cM from AltSB\n                 [14] were tested on Al tolerant and Al sensitive parental lines. STS M181 was monomorphic and could not be used in the genotyping of the Seredo x ICSR 110 F2:3 progeny. The CTG29_3b dominant marker that was successfully developed using the nucleotide polymorphic site, showed significant association with Al tolerance and therefore suggests the role of AltSB\n                 in contributing to Al tolerance in the population studied.SSRs can be used in cultivar genotyping, genotype identification, genetic diversity assessment and marker-assisted breeding [27, 42]. Matos et al. [43] developed EST-SSRs that are associated with aluminium tolerance in rye. The SSR markers that showed significant association with Al tolerance in the present study are located on chromosomes 3, 7 and 8. SSR marker Xtxp34 has been mapped to chromosome 3 [41, 44]. Sb6_342 was mapped to chromosome 7 [44] whereas Sb5_236 was mapped to chromosome 3 [41, 44], both of which were confirmed in the present study through BLAST searching of the sorghum genome. Similarly, the SSR marker Sb6_34 was located on chromosome 8 through BLAST search. These results indicate that in addition to SbMATE, other genes are involved in conferring Al tolerance in sorghum. Hence, there is a need to build on these findings by screening more markers close to the identified SSRs to ascertain the presence of new Al tolerance genes in these regions.The ISSR_811 primer amplified a distinct locus of about1400 bp (811_1400) that differentiated the two parents and also showed a significant association with aluminium tolerance in the F2:3 population studied. This marker is located close to SbMATE gene on chromosome 3 with about 366 kbp between them (Fig. 6), and hence the phenotypic variance of the aluminium tolerance indices explained by this marker is most likely due to SbMATE gene. However, 811_1400 (SCAR_811) is also located very close to Calmodulin-Binding Transcription Activator 4 (CAMTA4) on this chromosome with only 7.3 kbp between them. CAMTA2 is an activator of Al inducible ALMT1 expression in Arabidopsis AtALMT1 [45]. Marker CTG29-3b is located closer to SbMATE gene (with only 166 kbp between them) than marker 811_1400. However, 811_1400 explained more phenotypic variance (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.10) than CTG29_3b (R2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04) in NRLAl, in this study. This may suggest the role of CAMTA4 in regulating SbMATE gene in sorghum.The other two markers on chromosome 3 are located relatively far from SbMATE with 17.4 Mbp (Xtxp34) and 1.2 Mbp (Sb5_236) when compared with the locations of CTG29_3b and 811_1400. However, these markers explained higher phenotypic variance of the aluminium tolerance indices than CTG29_3b and 811_1400, which may suggest the presence of other genes around the vicinity of these markers that influence Al tolerance in sorghum. It is interesting to note that any pair of these markers on chromosome 3 explained more phenotypic variance than the variance they explained separately (data not shown) suggesting the independence of these markers in their contribution to Al tolerance. The four markers together explained 22% of the variance in NRLAl and 12% in %RRG (Table 2), which is higher than the variance explained by any three or two or one of these markers. Hence, combined use of these markers together with markers on other chromosomes is a preferable approach in screening sorghum genetic resources for tolerance to Al toxicity.The homeologous relationships between genomes of various cereals have been established [39, 46–50]. Previous studies [46–49] have shown that the long arm of wheat chromosome 4D (4DL) is partially homologous to the proximal portion of the short arm of rye chromosome 7R. Moreover, barley chromosome arm 4HL is homologous to the wheat chromosome arm 4DL [39] and a consensus grass comparative map has shown that rice chromosome 3 is homologous to wheat chromosome four [50]. An Aluminium-activated malate transporter 1-like (ALMT1-like) gene (LOC110436609) is located at position 43,835,494–43,840,158 bp on sorghum chromosome 6 (accession number Nc_012875.2). Marker 884_200 (SCAR_884) that showed significant association with aluminium tolerance in this study is located at position 42,689,435–42,689,555 bp on this chromosome. Since this marker is located close to ALMT1-like gene with only about 1.1 Mbp between them, and a strong positive correlation between Al induced malate exudation and relative net root growth has already been shown in sorghum [51], the significant association of this marker with aluminium tolerance is likely due to the role of ALMT1-like gene in Al tolerance. This also suggests that the sorghum ALMT1-like gene is an orthologue of ALMTI, as ALMTI gene that encodes Al activated malate transporter is known to regulate aluminium tolerance in wheat, barley and rye [17, 52, 53]. Hence, it is important that this gene is investigated in detail in relation to aluminium tolerance in sorghum.ConclusionThe four markers on chromosome 3 (811_1400 or SCAR_811, CTG29_3b, Xtxp34 and Sb5_236) suggest the role of AltSB\n                 locus (SbMATE gene) in Al tolerance in the sorghum population used in the present study. However, their positions on chromosome 3 in relation to the position of SbMATE and the phenotypic variance explained by each of these markers suggest the presence of other genes on this chromosome that play a role in aluminium tolerance in sorghum. The presence of four other markers on different chromosomes that showed significant association with aluminium tolerance suggests the presence of additional genes that contribute to this trait in sorghum. Since the eight markers together explained higher phenotypic variance of the two Al tolerance indices than what explained by individual markers or any other combination of markers, the use of all markers in screening sorghum germplasm for Al tolerance is recommended.DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA/SAREC) through the BIO-EARN program and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) through funding from the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of its special allocation on global food security (UD40).

Our analyses revealed that Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations have distinct genetic makeup and can be well distinguished based on either the genome wide data or a panel of ancestry informative markers (AIMs). Their genetic structure corresponds well to their geographical distributions, indicating geographical isolation played a critical role in driving population differentiation in East Asia. The most recent common ancestor of the three populations was dated back to 3000 ~<U+2009>3600 years ago. Our analyses also revealed substantial admixture within the three populations which occurred subsequent to initial splits, and distinct gene introgression from surrounding populations, of which northern ancestral component is dominant.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                These estimations and findings facilitate to understanding population history and mechanism of human genetic diversity in East Asia, and have implications for both evolutionary and medical studies.\n              KeywordsHan ChineseJapaneseKoreanGenetic ancestryPopulation structurePopulation divergenceAdmixtureSNPBackgroundEast Asia is one of the world’s most populated places, consisting of about 38% of the Asian population or about 22% of the world-wide population. East Asian peoples, especially the three major ethnicities, Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean, share many similarities in characteristics, for example, yellow skin, black eyes and black hair, short and flat noses, which make them hard to be distinguished by appearance. Moreover, East Asian people use similar languages and words, for example, Chinese characters are shared in Japanese, and also existed in Korean until their recent abolition in the 1940s [1].While many studies have reported the overall picture of genetic structure of global populations, finer scale details of population structure and relevant issues in East Asia have not yet been well addressed. In fact, in many previous studies, samples of Han Chinese and Japanese populations were generally treated as a single group [2], and notably, Korean samples are frequently absent from many important international collaborative projects due to their assumed similarity to Han Chinese and Japanese samples, such as the International HapMap Project [3] and the 1000 Genomes Project [4]. A recent study [5] provided a landscape of autosomal variation and an overall picture of the genetic relationship of Asian populations. However, fine scale genetic structure and relationship among Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations have not been revealed or well-studied, partially due to low density of the data.Here, we newly genotyped 100 Korean samples, and conducted a joint population genetic analysis with 182 Han Chinese individuals and 90 Japanese individuals. We attempted to address some fundamental questions related to the population histories of the three ethnic groups. First, we asked what the genetic make-up of the three populations is and how well they are differentiated. Second, we attempted to dissect population history of the three ethnic groups and infer their genetic origins based on state-of-art methods developed recently. Finally, we asked whether there were subsequent gene-flow occurred since population splits. We believe these efforts can advance our understanding of human genetic diversity and migration history in East Asia, and provide insightful information for future medical studies in the three East Asian populations.ResultsPopulation structure and genetic relationship\n                Genetic difference measured by FST\n                  To assess the genetic relationship among East Asian groups, we examined genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in 1032 individuals representing 12 populations. We first calculated pairwise FST based on genome-wide SNPs (Additional file 1: Figure S1, Additional file 2: Table S2). The three smallest FST values are between north Han Chinese (CHB) and south Han Chinese (CHS) (FST[CHB-CHS]<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0014), between Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna (CDX) and Kinh in Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam (KHV) (FST[CDX-KHV]<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0024), and between CHB and Korean (KOR) (FST[CHB-KOR]<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0026). Genetic difference between KOR and Japanese (JPT) (FST[JPT-KOR]<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0033) is larger than that between KOR and CHB, but smaller than that between two Mongolian populations (Buryat Mongolian (BMON) and DU Mongolian in Qinghai (QHM) [6], FST[BMON-QHM]<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0053). These results are largely consistent with the geographic distribution of populations. Generally, pairwise FST between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean (0.0026~<U+2009>0.0090) are greater than that within Han Chinese (0.0014), but are much smaller than that between European (CEU) and any East Asian groups, for example, the smallest FST between CEU and East Asian populations (FST[CEU-BMON]<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0838; FST[CEU-KHV]<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.1059) are higher by an order of magnitude. These results suggested a comparatively closer relationship between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean. More detailed information about the populations can be found in Additional file 3: Table S1.\n                Phylogenetic trees of populations and individuals\n                  A maximum likelihood (ML) tree reconstructed based on pairwise allele frequency difference provides a better visualization of the genetic relationship of populations (Fig. 2a). All the East Asian populations share a clade, and Mongolians are much closer to European than any other East Asian groups. Among the eight non-Mongolian East Asian populations, the Tibetan population (TIB) shows apparent differentiation from the other seven populations which are comprised of four typical mainland populations (CDX, CHB, CHS and KHV) and three island or peninsula populations (JPRK, JPT and KOR).\n                  An individual level neighbor-joining (NJ) tree of 1002 world-wide individuals based on genotyping differentiation was also constructed (Additional file 4: Figure S2A). African and European individuals cluster together respectively, and East Asians individuals also have their own distinct cluster. In East Asians individuals, Mongolian, Ryukyuan and Tibetan have relatively distinct cluster, while Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean showed a relatively mixed phylogeny, suggest their much closer relationship, although substructures are also apparent. Han Chinese samples also show mixture with Southern populations (CDX and KHV).\n                  Using only 6 populations (two Han Chinese populations, Japanese, Korean and two Mongolian populations) to reconstruct an individual tree, we found the phylogeny of the populations became clearer (Additional file 4: Figure S2B). Japanese individuals have their own cluster and Korean individuals are almost distinct from Han Chinese. North and South Han Chinese mixed together, but still have some substructure.\n                Principal component analysis\n                  We further performed principal components analysis (PCA) to examine the population structure on individual level (Figs. 1b, 2b, and Additional file 5: Figure S3). We first analyzed East Asian populations with populations worldwide based on 9063 genome-wide SNPs with inter-marker distance ><U+2009>500 kb (see Methods) (Additional file 5: Figure S3A). The first principal component (PC1) and the second principal component (PC2) explain 9.2 and 4.4% of the total variance (or 58.0% and 28.0% of the top ten PCs), respectively. East Asian groups cluster together closely and are located far from European or African in the PC plot, consistent with their differentiation from other continental populations. We observed some individuals, most of which are Mongolian individuals (BMON or QHM), extend towards CEU cluster, suggesting recent gene flow might have occurred between European and Mongolian populations. Analysis of a dataset with higher density markers (44,549 SNPs, after excluding JPRK samples due to lower marker density, Additional file 5: Figure S3B) showed similar pattern except that individuals were more tightly clustered (PC1 and PC2 explained 10.2% and 4.7% of the variance respectively).\n                        \n                      Fig. 1\n                          Asian samples location and population relatedness.

And the marked number are bootstrap value; (B) The top two PCs of individuals representing six East Asian populations, mapped to their corresponding geographic locations (generated by R 2.15.2 and Microsoft Excel 2010)\n                        \n                  Although East Asian individuals cluster very tightly in the context of analysis of worldwide populations, PCA of ten East Asian populations showed they have substantial substructure (Fig. 1b). For example, Han Chinese (CHB and CHS) and southern populations (CDX and KHV) were separated from other populations by PC1. According to coordinate of PC2 which explained 0.7% of the total variance, Mongolian and Tibetan are closely located in one side, while the island populations (Japanese and Ryukyuan) other side. Except Mongolian and Tibetan, other populations showed much closer relationship in the PC plot (Fig. 1b, Additional file 5: Figure S3C). Some Tibetan and DU Mongolian (QHM) individuals distribute toward CHB cluster, suggesting gene flow between these northern populations. These patterns are even more obvious when JPRK samples were removed from the analysis (Additional file 5: Figure S3C). High density dataset showed more pronounced substructure: On a finer scale, two Mongolian populations also showed substructure, and QHM individuals are sitting between BMON and TIB clusters which is consistent with their history [6]. In all the analyses, Dai (CDX) and Vietnamese (KHV) always cluster closely and can be separated from Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean (Fig. 1b, Additional file 5: Figure S3C).\n                  To examine genetic relationship of the typical East Asian populations, we did a separate PCA with some southern populations excluded (Fig. 2b). PC1 separates Mongolian from the other groups and explain 0.9% of the variance (or 21.9% of the top 10 PCs). PC2 separates populations living in the islands and peninsula from the mainland populations. Japanese and Korean each has each independent cluster, while two Han Chinese populations and two Mongolian both have some overlaps, and some Mongolian individuals are located toward CHB. Interestingly, the distribution of these clusters is generally consistent with the geographical distribution of these populations (Fig. 2b). We next performed PCA of only Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean individuals (Additional file 5: Figure S3D), PC1 explained 0.8% of the variance (or 20.2% of the top 10 PCs) and separated Han Chinese from Japanese and Korean. PC2 separated CHB and KOR from CHS and JPT. Japanese and Korean each has its own cluster and both are located apart from Han Chinese while CHB and CHS cannot be completely separated at this scale. These results suggested that although similar in appearance, Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean are different in terms of genetic make-up, and the difference among the three groups are much larger than that between northern and southern Han Chinese.\n                K-mean clustering analysis\n                  We classified Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean individuals by K-means clustering with first 10 PCs (Additional file 6: Figure S4). Assuming three clusters (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3), Han Chinese and Korean are not well distinguished, while all the Japanese individuals cluster perfectly. There are two clusters in Han Chinese and Korean, the north cluster (NC, in orange) and the south cluster (SC, in green). All the Korean individuals belong to NC while CHB and CHS have SC on average of  7.5% and 67.4% of SC, respectively. Assuming four clusters (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4), Han Chinese can be distinguished well from Korean. The NC at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3 separated into Korean cluster (KC, in blue) and north Han Chinese cluster (NHC, in orange) [7]. Around 64.0% of CHB individuals and 9.0% of KOR individuals are assigned to NHC, while 3.4 and 32.6% of CHB individuals to KC and SC (in green), respectively.\n                Screen ancestry informative markers\n                  We further explored whether the three populations could be well distinguished with a small number of ancestry informative markers (AIMs, see Methods). Individuals from any two populations can be distinguished with a sufficient number of AIMs, and we use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC, see Methods) to measure the clustering ability of AIMs (Additional file 7: Figure S5). As a result, we could use only 89 SNPs (CHB/KOR), 46 SNPs (CHB/JPT), 44 SNPs (CHS/KOR), 26 SNPs (CHS/JPT) and 73 SNPs (JPT/KOR) respectively to perfectly distinguish each population pairs. These AIMs can facilitate discerning and controlling of population structure among major East Asian populations in future association studies [8].\n                Origins, divergence time and migration history of Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean\n                To reveal the population history of the three East Asian ethnic groups, we conducted a series of population genetic analysis and estimation. We first estimated the effective population size (Ne) [9] of East Asian and worldwide populations from 5 to 250 thousand years ago (KYA), assuming 25 years per generation [9] (Fig. 3, Additional file 8: Figure S6). Our analysis showed that African population (YRI) had the greatest Ne before 500 generations ago (GA), and Ne of European (CEU) was also greater than those of most East Asian populations (except for CDX and KHV) before 1000 GA. However, East Asian populations all showed strong recent growth (~<U+2009>1% per generation during the recent 500 generations), so that Ne of most East Asian populations exceeded that of YRI during the recent ~<U+2009>12.5 KYA. In East Asia, CDX and KHV have the greatest Ne, followed by CHB. Tibetan (TIB) and Mongolian (BMON and QHM) have greater Ne than CHS and KOR before 500 GA, but grew slower than the later ones in recent 7500 years. Because of low marker density of the data, the estimation of Ne of JPRK might not be accurate, but apparently Ne of JPRK was the smallest. Korean roughly has the same Ne with Japanese and two Mongolian populations in history, but showed greater increasing rate in recent 12,500 years.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Effective population size varied along time. Effective population size (Ne) was calculated from LD observations in 2500 distance classes (from 0.001 cM to 2.5 cM with the window size set as 0.001 cM) for each population. Results from 2000 generations ago (GA) to 200 GA are shown (generated by Microsoft Office 365)\n                      \n                We further estimated divergence time (TF) of each population pair (Tables 1 and 2) based on FST (Additional file 2: Table S2) and Ne following the formula TF<U+2009>=<U+2009>2NeFST (1) [9]. Most non-African populations diverged from African ~<U+2009>82 KYA, consistent with the time of “Out of Africa” as suggested by mtDNA studies [9]. European and East Asian populations diverged later than that between African and non-African populations. Among East Asian populations, CDX diverged from CEU ~<U+2009>56 KYA, while the other East Asian populations separated from European about 35~<U+2009>50 KYA.Table 1\n                        Pairwise divergence time (TF)\n                      TF(GA)BMONCDXCEUCHBCHSJPRKJPTKHVKORQHMTIBYRIBMON06031399276315321265478238882843796CDX603022562181184823746032015275094518CEU139922560183916901369167619851782189615893290CHB27621818390242381221494711261993948CHS3151181690240238144738110592363682JPRK32148213692382380793791798943293156JPT26537416761221447902855410302793685KHV47860198514973379285023513474094172KOR2383201782478117954235010502253826QHM88152718961126105989410301347105009983988TIB284509158919923632927940922599803592YRI379645183290394836823156368541723826398835920\n                      Note: Pairwise divergence time (TF), in units of generations ago (GA), estimated by 2NeFST\n                    Table 2\n                        Results of F4 test\n                      popOpopApopBpopCF4(A,O;C,B)F4(B,O;C,A)YRITIBCDXCHB0.012550.01977YRITIBCDXCHS0.010190.02478YRITIBCDXKOR0.013330.01780CEUTIBCDXCHB0.010630.02007CEUTIBCDXCHS0.009570.02605CEUTIBCDXKOR0.012380.01917YRICDXJPRKCHB0.013170.00911YRICDXJPRKCHS0.018180.00843YRICDXJPRKJPT0.007230.02230YRICDXJPRKKOR0.011190.01547CEUCDXJPRKCHB0.012390.00734CEUCDXJPRKCHS0.018380.00788CEUCDXJPRKJPT0.007280.02052CEUCDXJPRKKOR0.011500.01442YRITIBJPRKJPT0.007660.02798YRITIBJPRKKOR0.012410.02116CEUTIBJPRKJPT0.007690.02849CEUTIBJPRKKOR0.012670.02239\n                      Note: population A (popA) and population B (popB) are two donate populations, population C (popC) is a target population who received gene flow, population O (popO) is an out group. Additional file 14: Figure S10C shows the model of F4 test. The value of F4(A,O;C,B) stands for the size of the common part of the two pathway A to O and C to B (labeled as l) on the tree weighted by the gene flow proportion a (labeled as al), and similarly F4(B,O;C,A) equals (1-a)m. And the calculation of F4 value noted in METHODS\n                    \n                We found that the present-day Han Chinese and Japanese have the most recent common ancestor that can be dated back about 3.0~<U+2009>3.6 KYA (corresponding to the Shang Dynasty in Chinese history). Korean and northern Han Chinese had frequent communications in ancient time, and the divergence time between the two populations was estimated as ~<U+2009>1.2 KYA (corresponding to the later period of Three Kingdoms of Korea, or the Tang Dynasty in China). And Japanese and Korean separated ~<U+2009>1.4 KYA, a little earlier than that of Han Chinese and Korean (corresponding to Asuka period in Japan, or in the middle of Three Kingdoms period of Korea).\n              Gene flow among east Asian populations\n                Considering their frequent communication in history, we are curious about how the initial common origin and recent gene flow contributed to the genetic make-up of Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations.\n                STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE analysis\n                  To examine fine-scale population structure and assess the genetic make-up of East Asian groups, we applied a model-based method, STRUCTURE [10], to analyze the genome-wide data with that of worldwide populations. East Asian populations showed distinct genetic component inferred from STRUCTURE which is totally different from those of European or African (Additional file 9: Figure S7). There is no more than 0.5% of African’s contribution in East Asian’s genome can be detected, while in Mongolian there is considerable contribution from European ancestry (12.5~<U+2009>16.9%) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3). We identified a component which we named northern East Asian component (NEAC) existing widely in the East Asian populations (Additional file 9: Figure S7, in red). On the contrary, southern East Asian component (SEAC) exists mainly in typical mainland populations (CDX, CHB, CHS and KHV) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, in green), and Ryukyuan component (RC) exists mainly in island and peninsula populations (JPRK, JPT and KOR) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5~<U+2009>7, in yellow). QHM has some Tibetan component (TC) (~<U+2009>8.98%) while BMON has very limited TC (~<U+2009>0.5%) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, K<U+2009>=<U+2009>7, in purple). We could also observe considerable TC contribution in CHB and JPRK (5.2 and 2.6%, respectively) (Additional file 9: Figure S7, K<U+2009>=<U+2009>7, in purple).\n                  To further assess finer scale population structure and genetic composition of East Asian populations, we run independent STRUCTURE analyses in the ten East Asian populations without non-Asian population samples (Additional file 10: Figure S8). At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>3, we observed a clear north/south cline of genetic components. SEAC (in green) constituted the majority (92.7%) of the CDX genome; Mongolian and Tibetan showed distinct composition but both were influenced by NEAC significantly (5.7%~<U+2009>15.0%) (Additional file 10: Figure S8, K<U+2009>=<U+2009>4, in red). At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5, Mongolian had different composition from Tibetan but showed considerable contribution from the Tibetan component (TC) (3.1~<U+2009>14.5%), especially in QHM, who migrated to Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau about 500 years ago and were reported to have adapted to local environment [6]. TC was also observed widely in other populations such as Han Chinese and Korean (2.3~<U+2009>12.6%) (Additional file 10: Figure S8, K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5, in purple). At K<U+2009>=<U+2009>6, RC was separated into two different components, one (in pink) mainly exists in island populations (JPT and JPRK) and has very little (1.4~<U+2009>1.7%) contribution to other populations, and the other (in yellow) exists both in island populations (JPRK and JPT, 39.1~<U+2009>66.7%) and northern populations (BMON, CHB and KOR, 4.3~<U+2009>41.7%) (Additional file 10: Figure S8, K<U+2009>=<U+2009>6).\n                  We confirmed the ancestry inference results with another commonly used method, ADMIXTURE [11] (Fig. 4). We ran ADMIXTURE from K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 to K<U+2009>=<U+2009>12 and chose results at K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 as the best inference according to ADMIXTURE’s cross-validation procedure (the best K has the lowest cross-validation error) (Additional file 11: Figure S9). Similar to the STRUCTURE results, East Asian individuals demonstrated three typical ancestry components which were entirely different from African or European. No strong influence of African ancestry on East Asian populations was detected (3.1% in TIB and no more than 2.4% in any other East Asian populations). However, we observed considerable presence of European ancestry in Mongolian population (15.5~<U+2009>16.1%) and some other East Asian populations (up to 6.4%). As shown in Fig. 4, the three dominant ancestral components in East Asian populations are NEAC (in red), SEAC (in green) and RC (in yellow). NEAC is also dominant in Tibetan and Mongolian and uniformly distributes in Han Chinese (27.3 to 39.4%), Japanese (24.5%) and Korean (39.9%). SEAC and RC are frequent in CDX/KHV and JPRK respectively, and both exist in other East Asian populations, while their proportions are generally negatively correlated across populations.\n                        \n                      Fig. 4\n                          Admixture analysis of East Asian populations together with world-wide non-Asian populations. Result of K<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 was shown and each vertical bar represents genome makeup of an sample individual (calculated by ADMIXTURE 1.23 [1] and R 2.15.2)\n                        \n                F test and D test\n                  We used the F3 test [12, 13] to detect potential admixture populations and a significant negative F3 value suggests existence of gene flow and possible admixture pattern. We tried each populations combination (F3 (population C; population A, population B)) and listed those with negative F3 values (Additional file 12: Table S3). We found that to some degree Han Chinese, Japanese, Korean populations each received gene flow from the other two. According to the F3 results, Han Chinese may have common origin with CDX and KHV, and receive gene flow from northern groups (NEAC) and from islands groups (RC). Japanese has significant JPRK contribution and can be treated as an admixture of Ryukyuan and other East Asian populations (Additional file 12: Table S3). The Korean population also has NEAC, SEAC and RC, but F3 results strongly suggest that it received gene flow directly through Han Chinese and Japanese (Additional file 12: Table S3). Our results showed that Mongolian populations (BMON and QHM) were admixed by European and some East Asian populations (for example, Han Chinese or Japanese, or their common ancestry, Additional file 12: Table S3), consistent with their known history.\n                  We further performed F4 test [12, 13] to quantitatively estimate the gene flow from surrounding groups to Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations, respectively. F4(A, B; C, D) denotes the common part of two drift route A to B and C to D (Additional file 13: Figure S11C). If A and B are two reference populations, C is a target population and O is the outgroup, then F4(O, A; B, C) and F4(O, B; A, C) have linear relation, which is equal to the gene flow ratio multiplied by common drift route (al and (1-a)m, Additional file 13: Figure S11C). Therefore, we can use linear regression method to estimate the gene flow (Additional file 14: Figure S10). As a result, NEAC contributed 52.2% to CHB, 44.0% to CHS, 19.7% to JPT and 37.5% to KOR; RC contributed 14.3% to CHB, 12.4% to CHS, 52.6% to JPT and 33.8% to KOR; SEAC contributed 33.5% to CHB, 43.6% to CHS, 27.7% to JPT and 28.7% to KOR.\n                  Finally, we applied the D test (4 population test) [12] to qualitatively estimate the gene flow Between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean populations (Table 3). In D test, a significant nonzero D values suggest the existence of gene flow (Additional file 13: Figure S11, more information can be found in Material and Methods part). Significant negative values were observed when D test were applied for comparing gene flow between Han Chinese and Japanese/Korean, indicating greater gene flow between Han Chinese and Korean than that between Han Chinese and Japanese. We further applied D test for detecting gene flow between Japanese/Korean and south/north Han Chinese, the D values were not significantly different from 0, indicating the gene flow between north Han Chinese and Japanese/Korean are almost equal to that between south Han Chinese and Japanese/Korean. These results remain consistent when different outgroups (CEU, YRI) were used in the analysis (Table 3).Table 3\n                          Results of D test\n                        popWpopApopYpopZD valueZ scoreCHBYRIJPTKOR-0.0055-5.061CHSYRIJPTKOR-0.0054-4.865JPTYRICHBCHS0.00141.515KORYRICHBCHS0.00161.649CHBCEUJPTKOR-0.0062-6.748CHSCEUJPTKOR-0.0060-6.596JPTCEUCHBCHS-0.0005-0.595KORCEUCHBCHS-0.0004-0.446\n                        Note: Population A (popA) is outgroup, population W (popW) is a reference population, population Y (popY) and population Z (popZ) are two potential target populations. If D value is significantly positive, it suggests that the gene flow between population W and population Y was greater than that between population W and population Z. On the contrary, if D value is significantly negative, it means the gene flow between population W and population Y was smaller than that between population W and population Z. If D value is not significantly positive or negative, it suggests that the gene flow between population W and population Y are equal to that between population W and population Z, or there is no gene flow between population W and population Y or between population W and population Z\n                      \n                DiscussionIn this project, we conducted a genome-wide study of three East Asian populations based on genome-wide high-density SNP data. Our results showed that the three East Asian populations, Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean, although they resemble each other in appearance, have distinguishing genetic make-up and are differentiated apparently on genomic level. In this respect, we suggest the three East Asian ethnic groups should be treated as independent populations in the future studies rather than as a single group, particularly in evolutionary studies or medical studies where population structure matters. In addition to global differentiation, the AIMs we screened also indicated considerable differentiation of local genomic regions among the three populations. For example, several highly differentiated SNPs (AIMs) are enriched in the CD46 gene (on chromosome 1q32), which is a type I membrane protein and is a regulatory part of the complement system [14, 15]. These highly differentiated genomic regions could be due to regional adaptation to some pathogens, although further studies are necessary to validate these signals and confirm this conclusion. These results further suggest the importance to consider population difference when medical studies are conducted in the three East Asian ethnic groups.It is obvious that the genetic difference among the three East Asian groups initially resulted from population divergence due to pre-historical or historical migrations. Subsequently, different geographical locations where the three populations are located, mainland of China, Korean Peninsular and Japanese archipelago, respectively, apparently facilitated population differentiation due to physical isolation and independent genetic drift. Our estimations of population divergence time among the three groups, 1.2~<U+2009>3.6 KYA, are largely consistent with known history of the three populations and those related. However, considering that recent admixture could have reduced genetic difference between populations, it is likely the divergence time was underestimated.We detected substantial gene flow among the three populations and also from the surrounding populations. For example, based on our analysis with the F3 test, Korean received gene flow from Han Chinese and Japanese, and gene flow also happened between Han Chinese and Japanese (Additional file 12: Table S3). These gene flows are expected to have reduced the genetic differentiation between the three ethnic groups. On the other hand, we also detected considerable gene flow from surrounding populations to the three populations studied. For instance, an ancestral population represented by Ryukyuan have contributed greater to Japanese than to Han Chinese, while southern ethnic group like Dai have contributed more to continent populations than to island and peninsula populations. Contrary to the gene flow among the three populations, these gene flows from surrounding populations are expected to have increased genetic difference among the three populations if they occurred independently and from different source populations. According to our results, the major source of gene flow to the three ethnic groups were substantially different, for example, the major source of gene flow to Han Chinese was from southern ethnic groups, the major source of gene flow to Japanese was from southern islands, and the major source of gene flow to Korean were from both mainland and islands. Therefore, those gene flows might have significantly contributed to further genetic differentiation of the three populations.The three populations have similar but not identical demographical history; they all experience a strong population expansion in the last 20,000 years. However, according to different geographic distribution, their effective population size and population expansion are different. North Han Chinese has greater Ne than south Han Chinese in early time. Japanese and Korean have similar Ne in most of the history, while Korean population expanded much faster than Japanese in recent thousands of years, suggested a higher potential for population expansion in peninsula than in islands. Our estimation showed that Han Chinese have much greater expansion speed than Japanese and Korean, suggested continental environment has even higher potential for population expansion than peninsula or islands. However, the estimated Ne increase in East Asian populations could be, at least partially, explained by recent population admixture which is expected to increase population genetic diversity thus increase Ne.Finally, as we briefly mentioned above, natural selection might have substantially contributed to the genetic diversity of the populations. We identified several genomic regions with significant differentiation between Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean. For example, most highly differentiated SNPs enriched in the genes that related to neurological system process and cell-cell signal transmission. There are also significant selective signals in detected in EGF-like domain and Collagen-like domain. The physiological significance and evolutionary importance of these selective signals needed more study.ConclusionIn summary, the genetic structures of the present-day Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean people were shaped jointly by initial population divergence, geographical isolation, subsequent gene flow and possibly regional natural selection. Our analysis of the genome-wide data of these populations and their surrounding neighbors should advance our understanding of population history and mechanism of human genetic diversity in East Asia.MethodsPopulation and samples\n                Peripheral blood samples of 100 Koreans unrelated individuals were collected from South Korea. Each individual was the offspring of a non-consanguineous marriage of members of the same nationality within three generations. Informed consents were acquired from the participants. All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Responsible Committee on Human Experimentation (approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, No. ER-SIBS-261408) and the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. In addition, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data of 182 unrelated Han Chinese, and 90 Japanese individuals were collected from the HapMap Project (International HapMap, 2003) and the 1000 Genomes Project [4], and comparisons were made with 663 individuals (630 individuals through Quality Control) representing 8 populations worldwide from the HapMap Project, the 1000 Genomes Project and the PanAsia SNP Project [5] (Fig. 1a, Additional file 3: Table S1).\n              Genotyping and data quality control\n                A set of 934,968 loci were genotyped in 100 Korean samples with Affymetrix Genome-wide human SNP Array 6.0. *.CEL files containing raw intensity data were analyzed with Birdsuite version 1.5.3 [16]. Only autosomal SNPs with missing rate less than 0.05 were employed for the downstream analyses. For the purposes of this study, only SNPs with Reference Sequence (RS) numbers and vendor-specified strands were used in combining data. For different purposes of analysis, several combined data sets were generated. The first two data sets (dataset 1 and dataset 2) contains 13,576 SNPs for 1002 individuals from all the twelve populations and 733,113 SNPs for 439 individuals from six East Asia populations (BMON, CHB, CHD, JPT, KOR and QHM). These datasets were used to estimate ASD. And dataset 1 was also prepared for principal component analysis [17], STRUCTURE [10] and Admixture [11] analyses, and estimation of gene flow, so that SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) have been removed from this data set. The third dataset (dataset 3) contains 44,549 SNPs for 596 individuals representing nine East Asian populations (except JPRK samples), which was used for population structure analyses of East Asian populations only. In the fourth dataset (dataset 4), we kept all the SNPs genotyped in all the samples respectively, and used for estimating FST and screening AIMs [8]. The last dataset (dataset 5) was based on the dataset 4 but phased particularly for calculating LD.\n                To control for potential batch effect during our data integration, we corrected allele frequency of BMON and QHM [6] by comparing genotypes of the identical CHB and JPT individuals between the data set of [6] and our own data. Because CHB and JPT were also included in the same data set together with BMON and QHM in [6]. To avoid any possible systematic bias introduced during data integration, we did SNP re-calling for HapMap individuals from raw Affymetrix intensity data (.CEL files).\n              Population structure analysis\n                Genetic difference between populations was measured by FST which was calculated following an unbiased estimate [18]. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed at individual level using EIGENSOFT [17]. The map was drawn by R (version 2.15.2) based on the information provided by http://www.mapsofworld.com/. We used an allele sharing distance (ASD) as a measure of genetic distance between individuals, and a 1002<U+2009>×<U+2009>1002 and a 439<U+2009>×<U+2009>439 inter-individual genetic distance matrixes were generated according to genotypes of 13,576 and 733,113 autosomal SNPs respectively (dataset 1&2). The tree of individuals was reconstructed based on ASD distance and using Neighbor-Joining algorithm [19] with the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software package (MEGA version 4.0) [20]. Trees of populations as well as components were reconstructed using maximum likelihood method [21] with CONTML program in PHYLIP package (version 3.695) [22]. K-mean clustering analysis was done with R software. Ancestry of each person was inferred using a Bayesian cluster analysis as implemented in the STRUCTURE program [23, 10]. We ran STRUCTURE from K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 to K<U+2009>=<U+2009>7 and repeated 5 times for each single K. All STRUCTURE runs used 15,000 iterations after a burn-in of length 15,000, with the admixture model and assuming that allele frequencies were correlated [23]. Admixture [11] was also employed for the same purpose.\n                We screened Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs) [8] to distinguish Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean. These AIMs were selected by the following three criteria: 1) allele frequency highly differentiated between each two populations (measured by FST); 2) inter-marker distance larger than 500 Kb; 3) Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of a panel of AIMs based on PC1 not less than 1.0. MCC is defined as the follows:$$ \\mathrm{MCC}=\\frac{TP\\times TN- FP\\times FN}{\\sqrt{\\left( TP+ FP\\right)\\left( TP+ FN\\right)\\left( TN+ FP\\right)\\left( TN+ FN\\right)}} $$ (5)where TP is the number of true positives, TN is the number of true negatives, FP is the number of false positives and FN is the number of false negatives [8]).\n              Estimation of effective population size and divergence time\n                We first phased the genotype data with BEAGLE [24]. In order to improve the accuracy of the haplotype inference (phasing), we combined those datasets from the same source and did further estimation independently.\n                Then we calculated pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2) of each SNPs pair with genetic distance less than 0.25 cM in each population. And effective population size (Ne) of t generations ago (t<U+2009>=<U+2009>1/2c (2) [9]) can be estimated for each population in each distance category as Ne<U+2009>=<U+2009>1/(4c)*[(1/rLD2)-2] (3) [9], where c is the genetic distance. All rLD2 are adjust as (rLD2–1/n), where n is sample size (number of chromosomes) [9]. Divergence time (TF) can be estimated by 2NeFST (4) [9]. Here, FST values were still calculated following an unbiased estimate. Ne was calculated as the average of the harmonic means of the relevant recombination distance categories. We used distances categories 0.01 cM to 0.25 cM (corresponding to 200 to 5000 generations ago) to estimate inter-population Ne [9].\n              Gene flow estimation\n                We used D test and F test to detect and estimate gene flow [12]. All the variations and Z scores are calculated by delete-m jackknife [25].\n                In D test, D value indicates the difference of the two allele patterns ABBA and BABA (Additional file 13: Figure S11A). A significant positive or negative D value (|Z|<U+2009>><U+2009>2.58, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) suggests the existence of gene flow either from W to Y or from W to Z. X is out group. In population genetics, D is calculated by$$ \\widehat{N}{um}_i/\\widehat{D}{en}_i $$ (6)\n                where$$ \\widehat{N}{um}_i=\\left(w-x\\right)\\left(y-z\\right) $$ (7)$$ \\widehat{D}{en}_i=\\left(w+x-2 wx\\right)\\left(y+z-2 yz\\right) $$ (8)\n                w, y, x and z are sample allele frequency of population W, Y, X, Z.\n                In F test, F2 value is calculated by$$ {F}_2\\left(A,B\\right)=E\\left[{\\left({a}^{\\hbox{'}}-{b}^{\\hbox{'}}\\right)}^2\\right] $$ (9)\n                (a and b are sample allele frequency of population A and B) and can be looked as the drift on edge A to B in a phylogeny tree. And$$ {F}_3\\left(C:A,B\\right)=E\\left[\\left({c}^{\\hbox{'}}-{a}^{\\hbox{'}}\\right)\\left({c}^{\\hbox{'}}-{b}^{\\hbox{'}}\\right)\\right] $$ (10)denotes the drift on the common path of edge C to A and C to B (Dx, Additional file 13: Figure S11B). If there is no admixture, F3 value should be positive. A significant negative F3 value suggests the existence of gene flow [26, 12, 13]. Similarly,$$ {F}_4\\left(A,B:C,D\\right)=E\\left[\\left({a}^{\\hbox{'}}-{b}^{\\hbox{'}}\\right)\\left({c}^{\\hbox{'}}-{d}^{\\hbox{'}}\\right)\\right] $$ (11)\n                If there was gene flow in history, the drift from one population to another would go through more than one path in the phylogeny tree; the ratio of drift along each path is decided by the ratio of gene flow. If there were gene flow from population A to population C (with a ratio a) and from population B to population C (with a ratio 1-a), then$$ {F}_4\\left(A,O;C,B\\right)=\\alpha l $$ (12)$$ {F}_4\\left(B,O;C,A\\right)=\\left(1-\\alpha \\right)m $$ (13)\n                Where l and m are unknown, but if there is a series of population C that are admixed with ancestry from both population A and population B (A’ and B') with different ratio, we can use a linear regression to eliminate these parameters, so that we can calculation each gene flow ratio a [13].\n              Abbreviations\n                AIMs: \n                    Ancestry informative markers\n                  ASD: \n                    Allele sharing distance\n                  BMON: \n                    Buryat Mongolian\n                  CDX: \n                    Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna\n                  CEU: \n                    Northern Europeans from Utah\n                  CHB: \n                    North Han Chinese\n                  CHS: \n                    South Han Chinese\n                  IBD: \n                    Isolation by distance\n                  JPRK: \n                    Ryukyuan\n                  JPT: \n                    Japanese in Tokyo\n                  KHV: \n                    Kinh in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n                  KOR: \n                    South Korean\n                  LD: \n                    Linkage disequilibrium\n                  MCC: \n                    Matthews correlation coefficient\n                  ML tree: \n                    Maximum likelihood tree\n                  NEAC: \n                    Northern East Asian component\n                  NJ tree: \n                    Neighbor-joining tree\n                  PCA: \n                    Principal components analysis\n                  QHM: \n                    Deedu (DU) Mongolians in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau\n                  RC: \n                    Ryukyuan component\n                  RS: \n                    Reference Sequence\n                  SEAC: \n                    Southern East Asian component\n                  TC: \n                    Tibetan component\n                  TIB: \n                    Tibetan\n                  YRI: \n                    Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThe authors thank Drs.

The transcriptome data of Notophthalmus viridescens, Xenopus tropicalis, Cynops pyrrhogaster, Hynobius chinensis and A. davidianus were obtained from the Genbank and reassembled except Xenopus tropicalis. The BLAST search of transcriptome data obtained 1244 single-copy orthologous genes among five species. A phylogenetic tree showed A. davidianus to have the closest relationship to H. chinensis. Fourteen positively selected genes were detected in A. davidianus and N. vridescens group and fifteen in A. davidianus and H. chinensis group. Five genes were shared in the both groups which involved in the immune system, suggesting that A. davidianus adaptation to an aquatic and cave environment required rapid evolution of the immune system compared to N. viridescens and H. chinensis.Keywords\n                Andrias davidianus\n              Comparative transcriptomeEvolution analysisAdaptive genesBackgroundAmphibians played an important role as a transitional group linking aquatic to terrestrial in the evolution of vertebrates [1]. To elucidate evolutionary history, the genome and mitochondrial DNA are traditionally used to estimate divergence time [2]. Transcriptome sequencing has become a viable alternative to provide rapid developing genomic resources in non-model organisms [3, 4]. Comparative transcriptome analysis is used to estimate the non-synonymous substitution (Ka) and synonymous substitution (Ks) rates to calculate the evolutionary rate [5, 6] and hence, to identify genes involved in environmental adaptation. Distribution of synonymous substitutions can be used to calculate the divergent time based on the coding sequence [2, 7].The Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus is a typical urodele, and an important species both as a biological resource and with respect to its value as a living fossil [8]. The species was historically widespread in China, but environmental degradation and human killing have led to its severe decline in the wild. From 1980s, it is classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Nature Resources. Because of its irreplaceable protection status and good taste, artificial propagation technology was studied and succeeded at the end of 1990s. Success of artificial propagation technology provided a value way to protect the wild resources. In wild, it is aquatic in all life stages and typically inhabits rocky crevices in banks of streams and lakes, as well as subterranean rivers. To identify genes possibly related to A. davidianus adaptation to its aquatic life history and to a cave habitat, transcriptome data of other amphibian species were obtained from GenBank, and comparative transcriptome analysis was carried out to detect genes positively selected for in evolution.MethodsRNA extraction and sequencing\n                Total RNA was extracted from five ovaries and testes using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according manufacturer’s instructions and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Takara, China) to remove the genomic DNA, respectively. After RNA quality and quantity test, RNA was broken into short fragment, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized, and then the sequencing adapter was added. The cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced on the Illumina sequencing platform (Illumina HiSeq™ 2500). All raw reads, low quality sequences, and reads containing adaptor sequences were removed, and the clean reads were obtained.\n              Identification of orthologues genes and phylogenetic analysis\n                Two gonad transcriptome data (SRR3308418 and SRR3308420) of A. davidianus were provided by my lab. To expand data of A. davidianus, transcriptome data of skin (SRX729810) and spleen (SRX729743) were obtained from NCBI database and reassembled with the gonad transcriptome data. Transcriptome data of N. viridescens from heart, lens, brain, eye, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, testis, and ovary (ERR108189), C. pyrrhogaster lens and neural retina (SRR1051839), H. chinensis whole body (SRR1042328) and X. tropicalis from genome sequencing (GCA_000004195) were also obtained. The unigenes were reassembled from the downloaded raw reads, except for X. tropicalis. The numbers of unigenes for each species is given in Table 1. BLASTN software was used to align sequences, with the cutoff E-value set at 1e-7 [9]. OrthoMCL software was applied to classify the gene family [10]. Orthologous genes were obtained, and Venn diagrams were used to obtain the gene number [11]. The orthologous genes were used to construct the phylogenetic tree by the NJ method with 1000 bootstrap replications.Table 1\n                        Results of the assembly for each study species\n                      SpeciesTranscriptomeN50GC %Max Length bpMin Length bpCDSXenopus tropicalis (XT)22,855241845.2194,44011422,718Cynops pyrrhogaste (CP)122,913159644.6118,37920149,986Notophthalmus viridescens (NV)31,99839244.48969720117,943Hynobius chinensis (HC)103,80042647.5415,29320151,362Andrias davidianus (AD)85,868149248.6117,74120143,402\n              Estimate of substitution rates among species\n                Form the orthologous gene, only one orthologous gene in other species was classed as single-copy orthologous by PERL package [12, 13]. The single-copy orthologous genes were identified to calculate the synonymous substitution rates (Ks) and non-synonymous rate (Ka). The amino acid sequences were aligned by Muscle software [14]. The aligned sequences were converted to corresponding nucleotide sequences. Synonymous substitution rates (Ks) and non-synonymous rates (Ka) were estimated between species pairs by sit model under Codeml program in PAML package [15]. The best threshold was set at 0.5 based on the Ka/Ks value according to previous reports [5, 6]. Value of two fold log-likelihood difference was used to perform a Chi-squared test and the difference of the parameter number was set as the degree in the Chi-squared. Positively selected sites were allowed when P was <<U+2009>0.05 and posterior probability was ><U+2009>0.95 [16]. A Ka/Ks value ><U+2009>1 indicated strong positive selection, from 0.5 to 1 indicated weak positive selection, and a value <<U+2009>0.1 indicated negative selection.\n              ResultsOrthologue identification and phylogenetic analysis\n                To identify the phylogenetic relationship among the species, large-scale transcriptome characterizations were carried out for N. viridescens, X. tropicalis, C. pyrrhogaster, H. chinensis, and A. davidianus, and transcriptome data were downloaded and reassembled (Table 1). Comparative analysis yielded 4279 gene families and 34,246 putative orthologous genes (Fig.1). To construct the phylogenetic tree with X. tropicalis as out-group, 1244 single-copy orthologous genes were identified. The phylogenetic tree showed A. davidianus to have the closest relationship to H. chinensis, with N. viridescens and C. pyrrhogaster clustered on one separate branch (Additional file 1: Figure S1).\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Venn diagrams showing the unigenes for comparative transcriptomes. The superscript indicates the protein family and the subscript indicates the unigenes\n                      \n              Evolutionary profile of Andrias davidianus genes\n                We analyzed the evolutionary pattern of 1244 single-copy orthologous genes in A. davidianus, H. chinensis, and N. viridescens. Synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitutions per site were observed (Fig. 2). A majority of sequence pairs showed a Ka /Ks < 0.5, implying that these genes involved negative selection. Fifteen rapidly evolving sequences were identified with Ka/Ks ><U+2009>0.5 between A. davidianus and H. chinensis, and 14 such sites were observed between A. davidianus and N. viridescens (Additional file 2: Table S1).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Ka/Ks ratio of 1244 single-copy orthologous genes. a.

The solid line shows the threshold of Ka/Ks = 1, the dashed line marked the weak positive selection threshold of Ka/Ks = 0.5, and the short dashed line represented threshold of Ka/Ks = 0.1\n                      \n              DiscussionNext-generation sequencing technology yielded a large number of sequences at the low cost and provides more sequences compared to traditional sequencing methods [17, 18]. Due to the cost and the throughput, genome-wide detection of the adaptive evolution gene was performed in many species by next-generation sequencing [17, 19]. Comparative phylogenetic analysis at the genome level improved the precision of evolutionary inference compared to single gene [20]. However, because of the large genome of the A. davidianus, evolutionary analysis by comparative genome was hard to carry out. Transcriptome sequencing was a valuable way to obtain large-scale sequences without reference genome [21, 22]. Phylogenetic analysis of transcriptome sequence data exhibited high supported tree topologies in many species [23, 24].To elucidate the phylogenetic evolution of A. davidianus, comparative transcriptome analysis was conducted to construct the phylogenetic tree with X. tropicalis as out-group. To search adaptive gene for aquatic and cave life, molecular evolution was analyzed among the related species. Synonymous substitution rates (Ks) and non-synonymous substitution rates (Ka) were calculated according to the phylogenetic tree by PAML software [15, 25], with the optimal threshold for selecting the positively expressed sequence tag (EST) of 0.5 based on previous study [25]. Several positively selected genes were detected. Similar results were found in topmouth culter Erythroculter ilishaeformis and zebrafish Danio rerio, in which 38 candidate genes exhibited signs of positive selection with dN/dS ratios ><U+2009>0.5 [6]. Five genes related to the immune system [26–29] [cystatin-like, oncostatin-M-specific receptor subunit beta isoform X1(OSMF), exonuclease, cell death regulator Aven, and centromere protein H] were detected in the A. davidianus/H. chinensis and A. davidianus/N. viridescens groups. Andrias davidianus is aquatic and inhabiting subterranean rivers and caves while N. viridescens and H. chinensis are mainly terrestrial and only special stage in water.Aquatic and cave dwelling organisms generally encounter more bacteria than do terrestrial animals. Thus, the A. davidianus immune system should show more rapid mutations, as was confirmed in our investigation. Due to lack of full-length according to the transcriptome sequencing, many gene relevant to positive selection was omitted and Ka/Ks ratio was decreased from normal level [6]. Further study will be carried out to identify the genes under positive selection.Abbreviations\n                EST: \n                    Expressed sequence tag\n                  Ka: \n                    Non-synonymous substitution rates\n                  Ks: \n                    Synonymous substitution rates\n                  OSMF: \n                    Ooncostatin-M-specific receptor subunit beta isoform X1\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank the Linen lab group for comments on data analysis.\n                Funding\n                This work was supported by National Nature Science Foundation of China (31502155).

However, about 40% of patients with ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer who receive tamoxifen therapy eventually develop resistance resulting in a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to mine available data sets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (tissue samples), and to identify all miRNAs associated with tamoxifen resistance (TamR) in breast cancer. Secondly, this study aimed to predict the key gene regulatory networks of newly found TamR-related miRNAs and evaluate the potential role of the miRNAs and targets as potential prognosis biomarkers for breast cancer patients.\n              \n                Result\n                Microarray data sets from two different studies were used from the GEO database: 1. GSE66607: miRNA of MCF-7 TamR cells; 2. GSE37405: TamR tissues. Differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified in both data sets and 5 differentially expressed miRNAs were found to overlap between the two data sets. Profiles of GSE37405 and data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter Database (KMPD) along with Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) were used to reveal the relationship between these 5 miRNAs and overall survival. The results showed that has-miR-542-5p was the only miRNA associated with overall survival of ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen. Targets of has-miR-542-5p were predicted by miRanda and TargetScan, and the mRNA expression of the three 3 target gene, Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/Tryptophan 5-Monooxygenase Activation Protein Beta (YWHAB), Lymphocyte Antigen 9 (LY9), and Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) were associated with overall survival in 2 different databases. Copy-number alterations (CNAs) of SFRP1 confer survival disadvantage to breast cancer patients and alter the mRNA expression of SFRP1 in cBioPortal database.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                This study indicates that miRNA has-miR-542-5p is associated with TamR and can predict prognosis of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, has-miR-542-5p may be acting through a mechanism involving the target genes YWHAB, LY9, and SFRP1. Overall, has-miR-542-5p is a predictive biomarker and potential target for therapy of breast cancer patients.\n              KeywordsBreast cancerTamoxifen resistanceBioinformaticsmiRNA-542-5pBackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and second leading cause of cancer death in the USA [1–3]. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator and one of the most effective adjuvant treatments for estrogen receptor alpha positive (ERa+) breast cancer patients in clinical practice. Unfortunately, about 40% of breast cancer patients with ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>who receive tamoxifen therapy develop tamoxifen resistance (TamR) [4, 5].The mechanisms of TamR include aberrant ERa expression, altered signal transduction pathways, imbalance of co-regulatory proteins, genetic polymorphisms in tamoxifen metabolism [6, 7], and epigenetic modifications including expression changes of microRNAs (miRNAs) [8]. miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally control the translation and stability of mRNAs [9] by forming specific base-pairing interactions between the 5' end of the miRNA (seed region) and the miRNA response elements within the coding region or untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, leading to mRNA destabilization and/or translational inhibition [10]. Fundamentally, miRNAs provide an extra level of regulation to gene expression.The role of miRNAs in the progression of endocrine-resistant breast cancer is of intense interest as they are promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets to counter metastatic disease [11]. Consequently, studies are rapidly emerging on the role of miRNAs in endocrine resistant breast cancer [12, 13]. Several miRNAs have been associated with TamR in MCF-7 cells exposed to tamoxifen (1 µM) for >12 months [14]. For example, expressions of miR-190b and miR-516a-5p were altered in TamR cells and were predictive of treatment outcome in a cohort of ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen mono-therapy [13]; miR-519a confers TamR by targeting a network of tumor-suppressor genes in ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer [15]; miR-27b is epigenetically downregulated in TamR breast cancer cells due to promoter methylation and also regulates tamoxifen sensitivity by targeting High Mobility Group Box 3 [16]; miR-320a sensitizes TamR breast cancer cells to tamoxifen by targeting CAMP Regulated Phosphoprotein 19 and ERR<U+03B3> in breast cancer cells and tissues [17]; and miR-378a-3p regulates tamoxifen sensitivity in MCF-7 cells through targeting Golgi Transport 1A [18].In this study, we used a meta-analysis approach to discover which miRNAs are associated with TamR across multiple studies in order to reveal strong miRNA candidates and down-stream target genes that can be used as predictive biomarkers and novel targets for therapy. To accomplish this, we mined the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed all the available in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (tissue samples) data sets for miRNAs associated with TamR in breast cancer, identified all the miRNAs related to TamR, predicted the key gene regulatory network of a novel miRNA associated with TamR, and evaluated the potential role of this miRNA and target genes as prognosis biomarkers for breast cancer patients. This is the first study to indicate and validate the potential association of miR-542-5p and its downstream genes Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/Tryptophan 5-Monooxygenase Activation Protein Beta (YWHAB), Lymphocyte Antigen 9 (LY9), and Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (SFRP1) with the prognosis of breast cancer.MethodsMicroarray data\n                From the GEO database we searched all available data on tamoxifen treated samples of breast cancer tissue (with resistance status) and all TamR breast cancer cell samples (Additional file 1), and found two sets of miRNA microarrays: GSE66607 and GSE37405. GSE66607 employed an Affymetrix GeneChip® miRNA 3.0 microarray to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between tamoxifen sensitive MCF7 parent cells and tamoxifen-induced resistant cells. The dataset of GSE37405 employed an Exiqon mercury LNA microRNA array on 152 ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>primary tumors from high-risk breast cancer patients, all patients had received adjuvant tamoxifen as mono-therapy (median clinical follow-up: 4.6 years). Patients were divided into two groups, patients without recurrence (denoted N n<U+2009>=<U+2009>76), and recurrence (denoted R n<U+2009>=<U+2009>76) [12].\n              Quality control\n                To ensure accuracy and reliability of this experimental design, the median value of NUSE (Normalized Unscaled Standard Errors) and the median value of RLE (Relative Log Expression) were used as evaluation criteria for each microarray. This method has been previously published [19].\n              Identification of differentially expressed genes\n                In GSE66607, differentially expressed genes were analyzed by Gene Cloud of Biotechnology Information (GCBI) working platform (GMINIX Informatics Ltd. Co, Shanghai, P. R. China), the rank is sorted by the absolute value of the fold change. Differentially expressed genes in GSE37405 were analyzed using GEO2R, an R-based web application that helps users analyze GEO data [20]. Data points with a p-value <0.05 were retained (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/?acc=GSE37405). All data are displayed as log2 transformed.\n              Strategy\n                As shown in Fig. 1 we used a multi-step strategy to identify miRNAs that become differentially expressed in TamR breast cancer cells and tissues. First, significantly changed miRNAs in GSE66607 (cells) and GSE37405 (tissues) were identified. Second, GSE37405 and Kaplan-Meier Plotter Database (KMPD) - an online survival analysis tool to rapidly assess the effect of 22,277 genes on breast cancer prognosis using microarray data of 1809 patients who accept endocrine therapy [21] with miRpower of breast cancer as the validated set [21] were used to screen overlapped miRNAs in step 1 that related to overall survival. Third, Targets of miRNAs were predicted by miRanda and TargetScan, to reveal the relationship between miRNA target genes and overall survival, the following tools and databases were used: KMPD, GEO (Affymetrix HGU133A and HGU133<U+2009>+<U+2009>2 microarrays) [22], and Gene Analysis Differential genes analysis (GEPIA). GEPIA is a newly developed interactive web server using a standard processing pipeline for analyzing the RNA sequencing expression data of 9736 tumors and 8587 normal samples in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression projects [23]. In addition, Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) and TCGA Provisional data in cBioPortal [24] were used to investigate the relationship between mutation/ Copy-number alterations (CNAs) and patients overall survival as well as the mRNA expression of target genes in breast cancer.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        The multi-step strategy used in this study. First, significantly changed miRNAs in GSE66607 (cells for miRNA in MCF-7/TamR vs MCF-7) and GSE37405 (tissues for breast cancer tissues) were identified. Second, GSE37405 and Kaplan-Meier Plotter Database (KMPD) for miRpower of breast cancer as the validated set were used to screen overlapped miRNAs in step 1 that related to overall survival. Third, for the target mRNA genes, KMPD, and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), were used to reveal the relationship between target genes and overall survival\n                      \n              Statistical analysis\n                For each triplicate of microarray data, analysis of variance for comparisons between more than two groups was used in analyzing the CNAs and mRNA expression. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Differences in dichotomous variables between groups were compared using Pearson’s chi-square statistic or Fisher’s exact test. Differences in continuous variables between groups were compared using the median score test. Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves were computed and compared using the log-rank statistic. Adjusted p-values were computed using Sidak’s procedure for pairwise comparisons after a significant log-rank test in overall survival value.\n              ResultIdentification of differentially expressed genes\n                There were 91 differentially expressed genes (48 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated miRNA genes) between normal and TamR MCF-7 cells in GSE66607 (Additional file 2). In GSE37405, 325 miRNAs were substituted as differentially expressed genes (Additional file 3). The two differentially expressed gene sets were overlapped and 5 miRNAs (Fig. 2a, hsa-miR-324-3p, hsa-miR-486-5p, hsa-miR-940, hsa-miR-542-5p, hsa-miR-421) were identified(Additional file 4).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Survival of tamoxifen resistance specific markers. a. The two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) sets (GSE66607 and GSE37405) were overlapped and 5 miRNAs (Fig. 2a, hsa-miR-324-3p, hsa-miR-486-5p, hsa-miR-940, hsamiR-542-5p, hsa-miR-421) were obtained. b.

(Log Rank =0.019), Red: high expression; black: low expression. c. In the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) data set, the high expression of has-miR-542-5p was also associated with overall survival in patients with ER- positive endocrine therapy in 695 patients (logrankP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00041, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6(0.45–0.8). Red: high expression; black: low expression\n                      \n              Survival analysis of TamR specific markers\n                Kaplan-Meier analysis of GSE37405 showed that high expression of has-miR-542-5p in TamR breast cancer tissues conferred a survival advantage to patients with tamoxifen systemic treatment [logRank (Mantel-Cox) p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.019, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.31(0.11–0.875), Fig. 2b]. In the METABRIC data set of KMPD, the high expression of has-miR-542-5p was also associated with overall survival in 695 patients with ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer receiving endocrine therapy [logrankP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00041, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6 (0.45–0.8), Fig. 2c]. Expression of the other 4 TamR-related miRNAs was not associated with overall survival in the GSE37405 dataset, but 2 of them [hsa-miR-486-5p: logrankP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.04900, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.74 (0.55–1); hsa-miR-421: logrankP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05800, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.33 (0.99–1.8)] seemed to be conferred a survival relationship to patients with tamoxifen systemic treatment in the KMPD dataset (Additional file 4).\n              miRNA target gene prediction and overall survival\n                1 miRNA target prediction\n                  Since miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression, upregulated miRNAs may result in downregulated target mRNAs. Targets of miRNAs were predicted by miRanda and TargetScan(Additional file 5). A total of three has-miR-542-5p target mRNAs were closely related to overall survival (Fig. 3) of breast cancer patients in both KMPD and GEPIA, and these are: YWHAB, LY9, and SFRP1.\n                        \n                      Fig. 3\n                          The mRNA expression of has-miR-542-5p target genes and overall survival value.

The left panel (YWHAB a, LY9 c, SFRP1 e) were verified in Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database Red: high expression; blue: low expression; and the right panel (YWHAB b, LY9 d, SFRP1 f) results comes from KMPD. Red: high expression; black: low expression\n                        \n                2 survival analysis of target genes\n                  High expression of YWHAB confers a survival disadvantage to breast cancer patients in both GEPIA with TCGA samples [logRank p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0057, HR (high) =1.6, Fig. 3a] and KMPD with GEO samples [217718_s_at, logRank p<U+2009>=<U+2009>8e-04, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.44(1.16–1.79), Fig. 3b]. While high expression of the other two target genes LY9 [GEPIA: logrankp<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.038, HR (high)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.71, Fig. 3c; KMPD: 210370_s_at, logRankp<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00014, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.66(0.53–0.82), Fig. 3d] and SFRP1 [GEPIA: logrankP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.028, HR(high)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.7, Fig. 3e; KMPD: 202037_s_at, logRank p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.00031, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.72(0.58–0.9), Fig. 3f] conferred a survival advantage to breast cancer patients.\n                  The cBioPortal was used to identify CNAs associated with survival in YWHAB, LY9 and SFRP1 and the relationship between CNAs and mRNA expression. There are 10% cases had genetic alterations in SFRP1 (Fig. 4a), and these alterations confer survival disadvantage to breast cancer patients in TCGA and METABRIC cohort [Fig. 4d logrank P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.011, HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.245 (1.051–1.474)]. The mRNA expression of SFRP1 was lower in cases with deep deletion (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.502), shallow deletion (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.000), gain (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007) and amplification (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.046) than that without change in METABRIC samples (Fig. 5e), which was similar to the results in TCGA (Fig. 5f). Alterations of the other 2 genes were not associated with overall survival in the cBioPortal (and Fig. 4b and c). And the difference between the mRNA expression and CNAs of these 2 genes were not obvious (Fig. 5a and b for YWHAB, c and d for LY9). In addition, the mutations of the predicted genes were also investigated in the cBioPortal, and they are all rare ones and little data is available for further analysis.\n                        \n                      Fig. 4\n                          Copy-number alterations of has-miR-542-5p target genes and overall survival value.

These samples were separated in to five categories, 1-Deep deletion (homozygous deletion), 2-Shallow deletion (heterozygous deletion), 3-diploid, 4-Gain (low level amplification), and 5-amplification (high level amplification). p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 compared to diploid group\n                        \n                DiscussionIn the present study, we mined all miRNA profiling data of breast cancer available in the GEO database to examine miRNA changes associated with TamR, and identified a novel target for TamR diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer patients. It is interesting to note that we found highly expressed has-miR-542-5p is associated with better overall survival in patients with ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer receiving endocrine therapy. In addition, three targets of has-miR-542-5p (YWHAB, LY9 and SFRP1) were also associated with prognosis in these patients.Understanding the molecular mechanism of TamR is of critical importance for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients [25, 26]. The results for 4 of the 5 TamR-related miRNAs found in this study corroborate with past findings. For instance, down regulation of miR-27b-3p enhances TamR in breast cancer by increasing NR5A2 and CREB1 expression [27]; deep sequencing analysis of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 over-expressing miR-335-5p and miR-335-3p revealed that this miRNA duplex represses gene expressions of factors involved in the ERa signaling pathway; thus, enhancing TamR in MCF7 cells [28]; miR-29b-1 has tumor suppressor activity in TamR cells [29]; and miR-221/222 is involved in cell cycle deregulation in breast cancer drug resistance [30]. Therefore, the novel strategy used in our study provides a reliable and robust meta-analysis approach to find strong miRNA candidates for prognosis biomarkers or novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, in the current study all the available miRNA data of breast cancer in GEO were included in the analysis and investigated with a comprehensive examination and validation. With this approach we identified a novel and very promising TamR-associated miRNA.Examining the relationship between TamR-related miRNAs and overall survival using data from GSE37405 and METABRIC, we identified a new candidate factor for prognosis, has-miR-542-5p. Two of the other 4 miRNAs, has-miR-486-5p and has-miR-421, might also be associated with overall survival in ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy. A significant change in their expressions was detected in the larger sample set (Additional file 4); however, there are discrepancies in the expressions of these 2 miRNAs between the GEO and KMPD databases, which might be caused by different sample sizes of the datasets. The role that has-miR-486-5p plays in the prognosis of breast cancer patients has also been indicated in other investigations [31].Studies have described the function of has-mir-542-5p in cancers. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed significantly reduced event-free survival in patients with low miR-542-5p expression (p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001, log-rank test) in neuroblastoma, which is consistent with the results of our study [32, 33]. The difference of transcript/translation expression for has-miR-542-5p between local and metastatic disease is very obvious in neuroblastoma [32], breast cancers [34], and endometrial carcinosarcoma [35]. Our research shows that high expression of has-miR-542-5p confers a survival advantage to patients receiving tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 2b), though has-miR-542-5p is overexpressed in breast cancer with lymph node metastasis [34]. Together, these studies suggest that has-miR-542-5p might be closely associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion ability, thus gaining migratory and invasive properties. Has-miR-421, another differentially expressed miRNA found in our study to be related to overall survival in the KMPD dataset, has previously been found to inhibit breast cancer metastasis by target E-cadherin [36] or metastasis associated 1 [37]. Recurring tumors after treatment with chemotherapy have an increased proportion of cells expressing EMT-associated genes, thus highlighting the importance of EMT in therapeutic resistance in breast cancer [38]. Other processes might also be involved in TamR. For instance, inhibition of miR-542-5p promoted efficient DNA repair and activated expression of Notch reporters [39]. In another report, miR-542-5p induced double-strand DNA breaks and reactive oxygen species accumulation in transfected cells [40], which might be related to the significantly increased sensitivity of therapy-resistant derivatives of breast cancer cells to a complex of DNA ligase III inhibitors that increased the number of DNA double-strand breaks [41].MiRNAs affect the development of various diseases by inhibiting the expression of their target mRNAs [42]. Understanding the relevance of miRNA and mRNA expression patterns in TamR breast cancer is important to elucidate the relationship between the pathophysiological process and gene transcription. We analyzed the relationship of the downstream target genes of miR-542-5p with survival of the patients in the KMPD and GEPIA databases, and found 3 target genes (YWHAB, LY9 and SFRP1) associated with overall survival. YWHAB plays a key role in cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation and has been reported to be involved in the development of breast cancer [43] and the activation of tumor/metastasis pathways and inhibition of apoptosis [44]. Knockdown of YWHAB upregulated connectivity hubs, successfully inhibited in vitro proliferation, colony formation, anchorage independence, migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells [45]. This is consistent with our results that high YWHAB expression is associated with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients (Fig. 3a, b), which could also be explained by low expression of has-mir-542-5p for these patients shown in Fig. 2b, c.The hazard ratio of the other two target genes (LY9 and SFRP1) could not be explained by negative regulation of miR-542-5p. This may be due to the different mechanism or other regulating factors in breast cancer. LY9 belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activation molecules family of immunomodulatory receptors and interacts with the adaptor molecule signaling lymphocyte activation molecules-associated protein [46], which is involved in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation pathways and lineage-specific markers [47]. Diseases associated with LY9 include Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. To our knowledge, there is no previously published report associating LY9 with breast cancer; thus, further studies are needed to evaluate the role of LY9 in the development of TamR breast cancer. SFRPs act as soluble modulators of Wnt-pathway signaling, which is associated with cancer proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Studies have reported that miR-27a affects in vivo and in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells through targeting the SFRP1 gene via Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway [48]. Expression of SFRP1 leads to antitumor synergy of combined HDAC and methyltransferase inhibitors in chemo-resistant cancers [49]. Furthermore, SFRP1 DNA methylation was reported to accumulate with age in normal-appearing kidney tissues and be associated with increased renal cancer risk [50], which indicates the importance of SFRP1 in cancer. In the present study, CNAs of SFRP1 gene is also closely related to prognosis (Fig. 4d), which might be related to the decreased mRNA expression in patients with these genetic alterations (Fig. 5 e and f). The mechanism of how has-mir-542-5p regulates TamR in breast cancer and how it influences its downstream target genes warrants further study.ConclusionIn conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of TamR-related miRNAs and reveals the association of certain miRNAs with the overall survival of breast cancer patients. The current study indicates that has-miR-542-5p is related to TamR and affects the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Regulating the target genes YWHAB, LY9 and SFRP1 may be a possible mechanism of has-miR-542-5p in TamR of breast cancer.Abbreviations\n                CNAs: \n                    Copy-number alterations\n                  EMT: \n                    Epithelial-mesenchymal transition\n                  ERa<U+2009>+<U+2009>: \n                    Estrogen receptor alpha positive\n                  GCBI: \n                    Gene Cloud of Biotechnology Information\n                  GEO: \n                    Gene Expression Omnibus\n                  GEPIA: \n                    Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis\n                  KMPD: \n                    Kaplan-Meier Plotter Database\n                  LY9: \n                    Lymphocyte Antigen 9\n                  METABRIC: \n                    Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium\n                  MIRNA: \n                    MicroRNA\n                  SFRP1: \n                    Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1\n                  TamR: \n                    Tamoxifen resistance\n                  TCGA: \n                    The Cancer Genome Atlas\n                  UTRs: \n                    Untranslated regions\n                  YWHAB: \n                    Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/Tryptophan 5-Monooxygenase Activation Protein Beta\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Dr. Xi Li for expert assistance.\n                Funding\n                This study was funded by National Natured Science Foundation of China (grant number No.81503563).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                All data produced by the study are disclosed in the manuscript and the additional files.\n              Authors’ contributionsParticipated in research design: Q-NZ, YG.

However, it is not known if calcium signaling pathway genes are also associated with SCZ in Han Chinese population.\n              \n                Methods\n                Here we investigated the association between genetic variants in three calcium signaling pathway genes (CACNB2, CACNA1C and CACNA1I) and SCZ in 1615 SCZ cases and 1597 controls.\n              \n                Results\n                A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs4522708) in CACNA1I is significantly associated with SCZ in our Chinese sample (ORA allele<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.19, corrected P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.042), suggesting that CACNA1I may also be a risk gene for SCZ in Chinese population. Of note, the risk allele (A allele) of SNP rs4522708 is same in European and Chinese populations. Meta-analysis of Chinese and European samples further strengthened the association of rs4522708 with SCZ (ORA allele<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.074, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.26<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-11). Expression analysis showed that CACNA1I was significantly up-regulated in hippocampus of SCZ cases compared with controls, implying that dysregulation of CACNA1I may have a role in schizophrenia pathogenesis.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our study suggests that CACNA1I is a risk gene for SCZ in Chinese population and provides further evidence that supports the potential role of neuronal calcium signaling in schizophrenia.\n              KeywordsSchizophrenia\n                CACNA1I\n              Genetic associationGene expressionBackgroundSchizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder that affects about 1% of the world’s population [1]. The core symptoms of SCZ include delusions, hallucinations and cognitive dysfunction [2, 3]. Adoption, family and twin studies indicated that SCZ has a strong genetic component [4]. The heritability of SCZ was estimated about 80% [4, 5], suggesting that genetic factor plays a crucial role in SCZ. Though numerous genetic linkage and association studies have been carried out in different ethnic populations and multiple susceptibility genes have been identified [6–8], only limited risk genes have been consistently replicated in diverse populations. The advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provides an opportunity to dissect the genetic basis of SCZ. In the past decade, multiple GWAS have been performed in world’s populations and multiple promising risk variants and genes have been reported [9–13]. In 2014, the schizophrenia working group of the psychiatric genomics consortium (PGC2) conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of GWAS through using 36,989 SCZ cases and 113,075 controls [13]. Over 100 SCZ-associated loci have been identified by PGC. A detailed characterization of the risk loci showed that calcium signaling pathway genes may play pivotal roles in SCZ [13]. Two calcium signaling pathway genes (including CACNA1C and CACNA1I) showed robust association with SCZ in PGC2, strongly implying these genes may be involved in SCZ pathogenesis. In addition, another calcium signaling pathway gene (CACNB2) was also reported to be associated with SCZ [14]. A recent trans-ancestry meta-analyses of Chinese and PGC2 samples (a total of 43,175 cases and 65,166 controls) further supports the association between CACNB2, CACNA1C, CACNA1I genes and schizophrenia [15]. These findings strongly suggest that neuronal calcium signaling pathway is involved in schizophrenia. To further investigate if these calcium signaling pathway genes are also associated with SCZ in Han Chinese population, we performed a replication study through recruiting 1615 SCZ cases and 1597 controls. We first genotyped three SNPs (one SNP in CACNB2, one SNP in CACNA1C and one SNP in CACNA1I) and tested their associations with SCZ in a Chinese sample. We then explored the expression level of these three genes in schizophrenia cases and controls. Our study indicates that a SNP in CACNA1I is significantly associated with SCZ in Chinese population, suggesting that CACNA1I is also a risk gene for SCZ in Han Chinese.Materials and methodsStudy subjects\n                We included 1615 SCZ cases and 1597 controls in this study. All of SCZ cases were from local mental health hospitals (or centers) and some of the patients have been reported in our previously studies [16, 17]. Diagnosis was finished by at least two experienced psychiatrists with DSM IV criteria. 61.3% of the SCZ cases were females and the ages of the SCZ cases range from 13 to 81 years (35.1 ± 13.26 years). Patients with history of head injuries and drug abuse were excluded in this study. Healthy controls were local residents and screened for lifetime history of mental illness. 63.9% of the controls were females and the ages of the controls range from 17 to 74 years (38.08 ± 12.31 years). Written informed consents were obtained from all the studied subjects and this the research was approved by the internal review board of Kunming Institute of Zoology, CAS. More detailed information about the sample description can be found in our previous studies [16, 17].\n              SNP selection\n                As the goal of this study is to explore if the calcium signaling pathway genes reported in European populations are also associated with SCZ in Han Chinese, we selected three previously reported risk genes for SCZ, including CACNB2 [14], CACNA1C and CACNA1I [13]. All of these three genes encode voltage-dependent calcium channel subunits. CACNB2 encodes voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel subunit beta-2. CACNA1C encodes Cav1.2, an alpha-1 subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium channel. And CACNA1I encodes Cav3.3, an alpha-1I subunit of a voltage-dependent calcium channel. For CACNB2, we selected SNP rs4748478, which showed significant association with SCZ in PGC2 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.0<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-3). For CACNA1C, we selected SNP rs1006737, which frequently reported to be associated with SCZ in previously studies [18–22]. For CACNA1I, we selected SNP rs4522708, which is also significantly associated with SCZ in PGC2. Of note, rs1006737 and rs4522708 reached genome-wide significance level in PGC2 (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.09<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-16 and P<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.41<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-16, respectively) [13].\n              Genotyping\n                SNP genotyping was performed using SNaPShot method as described previously [16]. Single nucleotide extension strategy was used for genotyping. Briefly, DNA fragments containing the SNP site were amplified first using PCR. The PCR products were then treated with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP) and Exonuclease I (ExoI), which remove primers and unincorporated dNTPs. The cleaned PCR products were then used as templates for single nucleotide extension. The genotyping primers were designed to stop just one base upstream of the interest SNP. As ddNTPs were used, so the polymerase extends the primer by one nucleotide, adding a single ddNTP to its 3' end. ABI 3730 was used to determine which base was added. More detailed information about SNaPShot genotyping method can be found in our previous study [16].\n              Statistical analysis\n                We used PLINK (v1.9) [23] to perform the association test (chi-square allelic test with 1 df). Bonferroni correction was used to correct the P values. Meta-analysis was performed using metafor package (http://www.metafor-project.org/) [24] implemented in R as described previously [25] and Fixed-effect model was used.\n              Expression analysis of CACNA1I in SCZ cases and controls\n                To explore if expression of these CACNA1I was changed in SCZ cases compared with controls, we examined the expression level of CACNA1I in SCZ subjects and controls using GES53987 [26]. In brief, 19 SCZ cases and 19 controls were included in GSE53987 and gene expression in hippocampus was measured. The raw expression values were processed as described in the original study [26] and student t test was used to determine if expression of CACNA1I is significantly changed in SCZ cases compared with controls.\n              Linkage disequilibrium analysis\n                Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis were performed using genotype information from the 1000 genomes project [27]. As all of the subjects included in this study were Han Chinese, we only used the genotype information of 103 Chinese subjects (CHB) from the 1000 genomes project to construct and calculate LD values (r [2]) among the SNPs. Haploview program was used to calculated LD [28].\n              Expression analysis of CACNA1I in human tissues\n                To explore the expression of CACNA1I in human tissues, we downloaded the RNA-seq-based expression data from the study of Fagerberg et al. [29] Briefly, expression data from 27 different tissues of 95 human individuals were used.\n              ResultsA SNP in CACNA1I is significantly associated with SCZ in Chinese population\n                We successfully genotyped the three selected SNPs (rs4748478, rs1006737 and rs4522708) in most of our samples. The overall genotyping call rate of these three SNPs exceeded 0.99. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis showed that all of the three SNPs are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Single SNP association test indicated that rs4748478 and rs1006737 were not associated with SCZ in our sample (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). However, we found that rs4522708 is significantly associated with SCZ (reference allele: A, ORA allele<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.19, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0145) (Table 1). Considering that we tested three SNPs in this study, we corrected P values using Bonferroni correction. Again, we found rs4522708 still showed significant association with SCZ even Bonferroni correction was applied (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0435), suggesting this SNP is also associated with SCZ in Chinese population.Table 1\n                        Association significance between the studied SNPs and schizophrenia\n                      SNP idChrA1aA2bFreq_AcFreq_Ud<U+03C7>2eORgPPcorrectedfrs474847810GA49.5%48.8%0.2991.0280.5851.0rs100673712AG5.43%4.96%0.7251.1020.3951.0\n                              rs4522708\n                            \n                              22\n                            \n                              A\n                            \n                              G\n                            \n                              86.11%\n                            \n                              83.92%\n                            \n                              5.981\n                            \n                              1.188\n                            \n                              0.0145\n                            \n                              0.0435\n                            \n                      \n                                aReference allele. bAlternative allele. cFrequency of reference allele in cases, dFrequency of reference allele in controls. eChi square value. fP was corrected by Bonferroni correction. gOdds ratio is based on reference allele. Significant associations were shown in bold\n                    \n                SNP rs4522708 has two alleles, A and G. The risk allele of rs4522708 in our sample is A allele (ORA allele<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.19, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0145). Of note, we found the risk allele of rs4522708 is also the A allele in PGC2 (ORA allele<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.071, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.41<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-10) (35,476 schizophrenia cases and 46,839 controls). We thus performed a meta-analysis through combing our samples (1615 cases and 1597 controls) with samples from PGC2 (35,476 schizophrenia cases and 46,839 controls). A total of 37,091 SCZ cases and 48,436 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity test showed there was no heterogeneity in the combined samples (P<U+2009>><U+2009>0.05). The meta-analysis (fixed-effect model) further strengthened the association between rs4522708 and SCZ (ORA allele<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.074, two-tailed P<U+2009>=<U+2009>6.26<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-11). Taken together, these results suggest that rs4522708 may represent an authentic risk variant for SCZ.\n              \n                    CACNA1I was significantly up-regulated in SCZ cases compared with controls\n                Our genetic association results indicate that CACNA1I is also associated with SCZ in Chinese population. To further explore the potential role of CACNA1I in schizophrenia pathogenesis, we examined CACNA1I expression in hippocampus of SCZ cases and controls. We found that CACNA1I was significantly up-regulated in hippocampus of SCZ cases compared with controls (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.019, Fig. 1), suggesting dysregulation of CACNA1I in schizophrenia cases. This expression analysis provided further evidence that supports the involvement of CACNA1I in schizophrenia.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        \n                                    CACNAI1 was significantly up-regulated in hippocampus of schizophrenia cases compared with controls. Nineteen schizophrenia cases and 19 controls were included in analysis\n                      \n              \n                    CACNA1I was highly expressed in human brains compared with other tissues\n                We found that CACNA1I was highly expressed in human brain tissues compared with other tissues (Fig. 2). In fact, CACNA1I has the highest expression level in human brains, suggesting this gene may have a role in human brain.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        \n                                    CACNAI1 is highly expressed in human brain tissues compared with other tissues. The arrowhead shows the human brain tissue\n                      \n              DiscussionRecent large-scale GWAS of schizophrenia (PGC2) have frequently reported that calcium signaling pathway genes were associated with schizophrenia. Of note, genetic variants in CACNA1C and CACNA1I reached genome-wide significance level in PGC2. In addition, previous study also showed that CACNB2 gene was a risk gene for SCZ. Though the associations between these three calcium signaling pathway genes and SCZ have been frequently reported, we noticed that most of the studies were from populations of European ancestry. It is not known if these three calcium signaling pathway genes were also associated with SCZ in Han Chinese. In this study, we genotyped three SNPs in CACNB2, CACNA1C and CACNA1I in 1615 SCZ cases and 1597 controls (All of the subjects were Han Chinese). We found that a SNP in CACNA1I is significantly associated with SCZ in our Chinese sample, suggesting CACNA1I may also represent a risk gene for SCZ in Chinese population. To further explore the potential role of CACNA1I in SCZ, we examined expression analysis and found that expression of CACNA1I was significantly up-regulated in SCZ cases compared with controls, implying dysregulation of CACNA1I may have a role in SCZ.Of note, a recent study also showed that genetic variants in CANCA1I were significantly associated with SCZ in Uighur Chinese population [30]. Six SNPs (rs132575, rs713860, rs738168, rs136805, rs5757760 and rs5750871) were found to be associated with SCZ in the study of Xu et al. [30] We studied the linkage disequilibrium between these six SNPs and the SNP investigated in our study (i.e., rs4522708). We found that rs4522708 is linked with two previous reported SNPs (rs713860 and rs738168) (Fig. 3). However, rs4522708 is not linked with other significant SNPs reported in previous study [30]. These LD analysis results suggested that several independent genetic variants in CACNAI1 were associated with SCZ. The observation of significant association between CACNA1I and SCZ in two independent Chinese samples implies that CACNAI1 may represent an authentic risk gene for SCZ. Consistent with these findings, a recent trans-ancestry meta-analyses of Chinese and PGC2 samples (a total of 43,175 cases and 65,166 controls) provided further evidence for the association between CACNB2, CACNA1C, CACNA1I genes and schizophrenia [15]. These results strongly suggest that neuronal calcium signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in schizophrenia.\n                    \n                  Fig. 3\n                      Linkage disequilibrium analysis among the SNP investigated in this study (rs4522708) and the SNPs that were significantly associated with schizophrenia in previous study. The significant SNP observed in this study (rs4522708) is marked with red box. The values of linkage disequilibrium (r [2]) were shown in the box\n                    There were several limitations of this study. First, only one SNP was selected for each of the three calcium signaling pathway genes in this study. Thus, the SNP coverage is limited. We could not exclude if other SNPs in CACNB2 and CACNA1C were associated with SCZ. Second, the sample size is relatively small in this study. Further replication study with larger sample size is needed to validate our results. Taken together, our study showed that CACNA1I is also associated with SCZ in Chinese population. Our results provide further evidence that support the association of CACNA1I with SCZ.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe thank all of the participants in the study.

The population also contain individuals with the Swedish long QT syndrome (LQTS1) founder mutation (KCNQ1/p.Y111C) which in homozygotes causes the Jervell & Lange Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) and hearing loss (HL).\n                Aims of the study were to test whether the Swedish long QT founder mutation originated in an ancestral HFE family and if carriers had an increased risk for hemochromatosis (HH), a treatable disorder. We also aimed to identify the pathogenic mutation causing the hearing loss disorder segregating in the pedigree.\n              \n                Methods\n                LQTS patients were asked about their ancestry and possible origin in a HH family. They were also offered a predictive testing for the HFE genotype. Church books were screened for families with hearing loss. One HH family had two members with hearing loss, who underwent molecular genetic analysis of the LQTS founder mutation, connexin 26 and thereafter exome sequencing. Another family with hearing loss in repeat generations was also analyzed for connexin 26 and underwent exome sequencing.\n              \n                Results\n                Of nine LQTS patients studied, four carried a HFE mutation (two p.C282Y, two p.H63D), none was homozygous. Three LQTS patients confirmed origin in a female founder ( b 1694, identical to AJ b 1694, a HFE pedigree member from the Fax river. Her descent of 44 HH families, included also 29 families with hearing loss (HL) suggesting JLNS. Eleven LQTS probands confirmed origin in a second founder couple (b 1614/1605) in which the woman b 1605 was identical to a HFE pedigree member from the Fjällsjö river. In her descent there were not only 64 HH, six WND families, one JLNS, but also 48 hearing loss families. Most hearing loss was non syndromic and caused by founder effects of the late 16th century. One was of Swedish origin carrying the WHRN, c.1977delC, (p.S660Afs*30) mutation, the other was a TMC1(NM_138691),c.1814T>C,(p.L605P) mutation, possibly of Finnish origin.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Deep human HFE genealogies show HFE to be associated with other genetic disorders like Wilson´s disease, LQTS, JLNS, and autosomal recessive hearing loss. Two new homozygous HL mutations in WHRN/p.S660Afs*30 and TMC1/p.L605P were identified,none of them previously reported from Scandinavia. The rarity of JLNS was possibly caused by miscarriage or intrauterine death. Most hearing loss (81.7%) was seen after 1844 when first cousin marriages were permitted. However, only 10 (10.3%) came from 1st cousin unions and only 2 (2.0 %) was born out of wedlock.\n              KeywordsHereditary hemochromatosisWilson´s diseaseLong QT syndromeJervell and Lange- Nielsen´s syndromeNon syndromic hearing loss\n                WHRN\n              \n                DFNB31\n              \n                TMC1\n              BackgroundRiver valley populations of northern Sweden are well suited for research of monogenic diseases because the wilderness between them creates sub-isolates [1]. This usually mean a good breeding ground for autosomal recessive (AR) diseases like hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), common in the river valleys of Jämtland [2, 3]. In this disease, homozygous carriers of the HFE/p.C282Y mutation have an increased ability to absorb iron due to reduced levels of hepcidin, the iron regulating hormone of the liver [4].With time, the iron loading can reach toxic amounts affecting multiple organs in particular the liver, but most often the phenotype is mild. The disease was once regarded rare in Scandinavia and England, possibly due to widespread iron deficiencies in these countries [5]. Paradoxically these and other north European countries today demonstrate the highest mutation frequencies in the world, suggesting selective advantages [6, 7]. A recent study seemed to indicate that that the HFE/p.C282Y could segregate other mutations, when Wilson´s disease (WND), a rare recessive copper loading disorder [8, 9] appeared in a HH family of the Swedish west coast. Shortly afterwards this was repeated in a deep HFE family of the Fjällsjö river in northern Jämtland [10]. The Swedish long QT syndrome (LQTS) founder mutation is now reported to originate in this population [11].LQTS is an autosomal dominant inherited cardiac arrhythmic disorder which in homozygotes also causes hearing loss, and the Jervell and Lange- Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) [12], a surprisingly rare disorder, according to a recent study by the same authors [13]. By extensive genealogic investigations the authors were able to trace individuals carrying the long QT mutation (KCNQ1/p.Y111C) to common founders, one, a female born 1694 [14], the other a couple born 1605 and 1614 [11]. The origin and geographic spread of the LQTS mutation, described in detailed maps [11] fascinated us as it seemed to coincide with the p.C282Y mutation [2] in its upstream spread into Lapland. This land of 15000 km2 north of N 63.9 was opened for colonization by the Lapland Bill of 1673, a matter of great relief for expanding post war populations such as the Fjällsjö (from n<U+2009>=<U+2009>91 in 1620 to n<U+2009>=<U+2009>299 in 1751) [15]. As an upstream migration would most likely result in matches between mutation carriers and risk for homozygous children [2, 3, 16] we would expect not only HH but also JLNS along the lines of descent. Despite a law change in 1844 permitting 1st cousin unions [17], JLNS was surprisingly rare as only one (p.Y111C/p.Y111C) afflicted individual have been found [13]. Singular JLNS subjects have however, been reported [18] and according to a parish meeting protocol (from 1831) there were families with deaf mute children in the new habitat [19]. Assuming they may represent historic JLNS, church registries were screened for hearing loss families.The only way at this time to identify the two LQTS founder families [11, 14] was to ask systematically LQTS patients about their ancestry and its possible origin in hemochromatosis founder families. Like HH patients [2, 3] LQTS families have been detected and reported [20] from the county hospital in Östersund and subsequently by other workers (Olof Lövheim and Anders Gard) at the same hospital.Aims\n                The purpose of this study was to find out whether patients with the Swedish LQTS founder mutation (KCNQ1/p.Y111C) had an increased risk for HH, by sharing origin within hemochromatosis (HH) families. We also aimed to determine the origin and the molecular genetic background of the hearing loss disorder segregating in the pedigree.\n              MethodsAfter obtaining permission from their doctors, LQTS patients from 11 families were contacted and asked about their ancestry. Before contact they were given written information about hemochromatosis and the aims of the study. Hearing loss patients were also contacted and all consented to an interview, and gave written consent to blood tests. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board at the University of Göteborg, (Dnr 834/14) ,T 214/16 and T1076-16). Genealogic data were extended through information from the genealogists Mr Georg Hansson and Mr Olof Stenum as previously described [2, 10] and the results were registered in our hemochromatosis/ Wilson disease database, Holger 7, (http://5493.shop.textalk.se) comprising n = 11076 individuals [10]. Added to the same registry was the ancestry of families with deaf or deaf- mute children detected in church registries by Mr Stenum. During the interviewing process additional hemochromatosis patients were identified and added to the registry that now comprises (n = 13720) individuals. Results were given in pedigrees drawn manually in Cyrillic 2.1 (Cyrillic Software, Old Beaconsfield, UK). In hemochromatosis patients serum iron, transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin, liver enzymes and HFE mutations were analyzed as previously described [2]. LQTS patients were tested for HFE mutations in the LightCycler™ (Roche Diagnostics Gmbh Mannheim, Germany). Sequencing of the KCNQ1/p.Y111C LQTS founder mutation was performed at the laboratory of Clinical Genetics, Umeå University hospital [14], Umeå, Sweden. Sequencing and multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) of the GJB2(Cx26) gene was performed at department of Clinical Genetics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. Whole exome sequencing was performed by using Ion AmpliSeq™ Exome Library preparation protocol (Thermo Fisher and sequencing by the Ion Chef system as described in Bondeson et al [21]. Primer sequences and PCR conditions for Sanger sequencing of WHRN (NM_001173425), c.1977delC, (p.S660Afs*30), and TMC1(NM_138691), c.T1814C,(p.L605P) are available upon request.Setting\n                The study area included the Angerman river and its tributaries the Fax river and the Fjällsjö river [2, 11]. In 1974 the study area was divided with the upstream parishes Fjällsjö, Bodum and Tåsjö being transferred to the county of Jämtland. This might have been of importance because the single county hospital in Östersund happened to dispose of a laboratory equipment (Autochemist) including routine determinations of serum iron and transferrin saturation (TS) [2, 3]. As an elevated TS is an early biochemical marker of iron overload [4], this gave us unique opportunities to detect hemochromatosis.\n              ResultsThree hypotheses were examined\n                1. The LQTS founders originated in HFE families\n                1 A. Is the first KCNQ1/Y111C founder, a woman b 1694 [14] identical to A J b 1694? If so she is seen as V:16 in our Fax river hemochromatosis pedigree, Additional file 1: Figure S1 [2].\n                1 B. Is the second founder family b 1614 and 1605 [11] identical to KA b 1614 married to I O b 1605? If so they are identical to III:1 and III:2 in our Fjällsjö river hemochromatosis pedigree , (Additional file 1: Figure S2) [2].\n                2. If true, there would be a high probability for JLNS in the descent of 1 A, AJ b 1694 and 1 B, IO b 1605, and\n                3. An increased risk for hemochromatosis in LQTS carriers.\n                \n                           1 A.

They shared origin in AJ b 1694, identical to V:16 in our Fax river hemochromatosis pedigree [2] (see Additional file 1: Figure S1). AJ had moved in from the Fax river (see family 526 www.5560.se/familjer/fam-str.pdf to settle new land in Lapland upstream in the Fjällsjö river valley in 1732. Her two children (belonging to different marriages) had a descent who married descent members of another pioneer couple b 1727/1729, their closest neighbor living 4 km downstream the Fjällsjö river. AJ:s daughter II:3 b 1739 died at age 32 from smallpox but had with her husband 6 children who survived to reproduce.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Pedigree showing individuals with Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and hereditary hemochromatosis (HH).

These findings shown in Fig. 2 agree well with the Winbo et al pedigree /Fig. 3/ [11] supporting our second hypothesis. The first LQTS founder AJ b 1694 is seen as IV:1 and the 1727/1729 family of Fig. 1 now appears as V:3-4 and is identical to V:5 in the Winbo et al pedigree /Fig. 3/ [11], which connected 10 (38.4%) of the 26 long QT families. Repeated consanguineous marriages were seen, however without hearing loss other than in XII:12. The degree of coinheritance with HFE/p.C282Y was substantial but involved only the upstream migration while the downstream descent from II:3 seemed unaffected by the p.C282Y.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Pedigree connecting families with LQTS and HH to a common founder couple b 1614/1605.

Hearing loss suggesting JLNS in the descent of a LQTS founder b 1694 [14].\n                        \n                The descent of the first founder AJ b 1694 comprised 25 A4 pages in agreement with a high reproduction and a high frequency of HH families (n = 49). For clarity these were excluded in the pedigree of Fig. 3, which contained not only four 4 LQTS families, but also 29 families with deaf mute children suggesting JLNS. Phenotypic expression other than hearing loss was most often mild and sudden death was rarely reported.\n                \n                  2 B. Hearing loss suggesting JLNS in the descent of the LQTS 1605/1614 founder family.\n                \n                The descent of the second founder family comprised 106 A4 pages and was difficult to illustrate in Cyrillic, mainly due to the high number of HH families (n = 64), of whom 35 (55%) were in common with the first founder AJ. There were also six WND families [10] and 48 families with hearing loss of whom 15 were in common with the first founder. A simplified pedigree is seen in Fig. 4 including a 1st cousin marriage (III:1-III:2) and the descent from one (IV:1) of their 11 children. In her descent was the D 9 family with a nine year old daughter who died on the 4th of October 1839 ‘af slag, döfstum’ = (from stroke, deaf- mute). This was shortly after her mother´s death, aged 33, during her 5th childbirth on 14th of September 1839. As emotional stress may initiate serious arrhythmic events, this might have been the background of the “stroke”. The mother had lost another stillbirth and also three other children, of whom two died within their first three days of life. The parents of the 9 year old girl were only distantly related to the LQTS 1605/1614 founder II family.\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Pedigree showing families with LQTS and hearing loss (suspected Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome (JLNS). D 9 was deaf-mute and died of stroke at age 9 suggesting JLNS. The pedigree also show connection to a hemochromatosis founder family born 1580 in which three HL families D 87, D 24 and D 86 were available for molecular genetic evaluation. The D 24 parents were 3rd cousins once removed from a marriage 1788 marked with a vertical arrow. The LQTS founder II family is marked by a left upper arrow. Symbols as in Fig. 2\n                                    \n                      \n                The D 24 family was of interest because of the two deaf mute siblings XII:18 and XII:21were still alive in 2014 and available for a molecular genetic evaluation. Their two brothers with HH , XII:22 and XII:23 had been previously reported as homozygous carriers of the HLA A3B7 haplotype [2], (See: S2 XIII:43-44, down right arrow) suggesting a common origin. In support of a possible JLNS was the sudden death of their brother XII:19 at age 14 (stroke of lightning) and a record from 1967 when the oldest brother XII:18, was observed at hospital after fainting. An ECG showed however, normal QT duration and a subsequent test negative for the KCNQ1/p.Y111C mutation excluded the possibility of JLNS.\n                Mutation analysis of the GJB2 gene encoding connexin 26, did not reveal any mutations in families D 24, D 86 and D 87 thus excluding DFNB1, the most common form of autosomal recessive HL. Exome sequencing of XII:18 and XII: 21 (Fig. 4) following a recessive filtering towards an in-house database (consisting of 1400 ethically matched controls) and publicly available database revealed an interesting finding .One novel homozygous variant, c.1977delC,(p.S660Afs*30) in the WHRN gene (also denoted DFNB31) (NM_001173425),was found which, encodes the whirlin protein. Mutations in WHRN have previously been shown to cause autosomal recessive non syndromic deafness [22] and Usher syndrome type 2D [23]. The novel variant c.1977delC,(p.S660Afs*30) was considererd to be pathogenic since it results in a frame-shift, and is present in homozygous form in the family and the normal population frequency is very low. Segregation analysis of the p.S660Afs*30 was performed in D 86 and in XII:16 of the D 87 family, and none of the individuals investigated carried the mutation.\n                In the D87 family exome sequencing was performed of the two unrelated HL parents XII:16 and XII:15 (from a distant river valley), and the youngest of their three deaf mute children, XIII:12, following a recessive filtering as described above. All family members were homozygous for a novel missense variant in the TMC1 gene c.T1814C,(p.L605P), (NM_138691). Mutations in the TMC1 gene are causing autosomal recessive HL [24] and is one of the most commonly mutated genes in the Western-European population [25]. The variant c.1814C,(p.L605P) was considered to be likely pathogenic since it is present in extremely low frequency in the normal population and is located in the TMC domain. There are multiple lines of computational evidence that support a deleterious effect and it is present in homozygous form in the family. The TMC1 mutation was not identified in D 24 and D 86 supporting the presence of at least two different HL mutations in the population. The hearing loss in D 86, was most probably caused by his mother´s rubeola infection.\n              Origin of mutations\n                Parents of the D 24 family with the WHRN/p.S660Afs*30 mutation were 3rd cousins once removed from a remote consanguineous marriage in 1778 marked by an arrow in Fig. 4. Further extension revealed a possible founder origin in a family of the late 16th century from village K in the parish of Anundsjö. This founder family seen in Fig. 5 had a descent with similarly affected HL families living in the parish. The VI:1-2 family (family size 14, effective family size 6) had members who migrated into the new habitat. They are recognized in the pedigree of Fig. 3 (marked in red). The village K family (comprising 139 A4 pages) had a total of 60 HL families in its descent (data not shown), but the D 87 was not included suggesting a different origin of that mutation.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Pedigree of the D 24 family presenting the origin and segregation of the p.S660Afs*30 mutation of the WHRN DFNB31gene. Two siblings from a marriage in 1778 (arrow) may have introduced the mutation by co migration with the HFE mutation (in blue). A founder effect of the late 16th century seems likely. VI:1-2 is equal to II:5-6 of Fig. 3\n                                    \n                      \n                The mother of the D 87 family, homozygous for the TMC1/L605P mutation, originated from a consanguineous marriage in which both parents shared origin in a HL family of the late 18th century as seen in Fig. 6. Further extension revealed a common origin in a Finnish migrant family of the late 16th century. Their descent is seen in Fig. 7 connecting 68 HL families (of whom 54 were in common with the village K family). Although extensive, the pedigree is incomplete because for clarity, nine WND families, seven LQTS and 75 HFE families had to be excluded. Most hearing loss families (81.4%) were seen after 1844 when first cousin marriages were permitted. However, only 10 (10,3 %) came from 1st cousin unions, there were 11 (11.7%) of 2nd cousins, 16 (17.0 %) 3rd and 5 (5.3 %) 4th cousins. A remote consanguinity was present in 18(19.1 %). Only 2 (3.6 %) were born out of wedlock.\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        Pedigree showing the ancestry of the D 87 family with homozygosity for the TMC1/p.L605P in repeat generations.

None was homozygous.\n                Electrocardiograms have not been rechecked in all of HH probands, only in those with a history of arrhythmia. None was found to have prolonged QT duration. One retested was a 43 year old male in the descent of LQTS founder II family who had serious arrhythmic events needing implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) treatment. He had normal hearing and normal QT intervals but had a severe HH phenotype (to be published).\n              DiscussionIn the present study we could verify the first and second hypotheses but not the third. The genealogic studies suggest that the Swedish LQTS founder mutation KCNQ1/p.Y111C [11, 14] shared an origin and segregated with the HFE mutation [2] in a river valley population of northern Sweden (Figs 1, 2, and 3 and Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Figure S2) . It is known that genetic material with potentially modifying properties may co-segregate with the deleterious mutation [11], however, there is little evidence to support iron or HFE mutations [26, 27], as contributing factors to the mild phenotype seen in the Swedish LQTS families [11, 14]. The map findings of LQTS upstream the river [11] are fascinating, not only for corresponding with HFE, but also for the hearing loss families along the same pathways. Such families existed in the new habitat because a parish meeting protocol (of 1831) informed that “deaf mute children at age 11 to 14 years had a chance of a free place at a hearing institute” [19]. There would be a high probability for KCNQ1/p.Y111C homozygosity and JLNS [13], because of a preference of LQTS mutation carriers to marry within the same river valley [1, 11, 14] and also because first cousin unions were no longer prohibited by law. This law change in 1844 had been shown to have a major influence on hereditary diseases in northern Sweden [17]. The consanguineous marriages shown in Fig. 1 and the findings of 29 hearing loss families shown in Fig. 3, was therefore not surprising. They could well represent JLNS, but against such a diagnosis was a phenotype in which sudden death was rarely reported. Similar observations were made in the descent of the second LQTS founder (Fig. 4) with one exception, the D 9 family, which was severely affected and may well represent JLNS. Three other individuals afflicted with JLNS from the same hospital [18] may belong to this founder family of Fig. 4. It is possible that homozygous pregnancies were selected against resulting in early abortion or intrauterine death of their outcome [13]. As we have found such families to occur, and also families with multiple miscarriages, this may explain the rarity of JLNS. Surprising was the rarity of JLNS in inbred LQTS families with repeat consanguineous marriages seen in Fig. 2. However, homozygous carriers without hearing loss have been known since 1998 [28] and may contain a 10% residual KCNQ1 function that rescues hearing [29]. In such high-risk families fetal heart rate observations have been helpful to predict the phenotype in LQTS [30].Origin and nature of non syndromic hearing loss detected by exome sequencing\n                The genetic tests of the D 24 family excluded the JLNS and DFNB1 because screening of the LQTS KCNQ1/p.Y111C and GJB2 did not reveal homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations [31]. However , exome sequencing revealed the presence of a mutation WHRN/p.S660Afs*30 at the DFNB31 locus [22].This mutation was possibly introduced in a marriage of 1778 seen as VI:15-16 of Fig. 4 (marked by an arrow). Further genealogic studies supported the presence of a local founder effect with hearing loss families connected through consanguineous marriages in the parish of Anundsjö as shown in Fig. 5. There was a considerable spread of the supposed WHRN gene from the founder family into the new habitat and the VI:1-2 of Fig. 5 is an example with a significant effect (marked in red) upon the pedigree of Fig. 3. The DFNB31 locus was first identified in a Palestinian family living in Jordan [22] and in a Tunisian kindred [32], but is not a common cause of hearing loss [22].\n                We were surprised that the D87 family, with hearing loss in successive generations [18], lacked the WHRN/S660Afs*30 mutation. However, exome sequencing of the two HL parents and one of their three HL children showed all three to be homozygous for TMC1/p.L605P. The TMC1 gene has previously been reported to cause autosomal recessive hearing loss [24]. Like WHRN, it is also reported from Tunisia [33] and Morocco [34], but also from Western [25] and Eastern [35] Europe. Extensive genealogic studies seen in Figs. 6 and 7 now support a possible Finnish founder origin. This vast pedigree and the pedigree of Fig. 5 may well explain most of the hearing loss of previous pedigrees, Figs. 3 and 4.\n                We can not exclude the possibility of single cases being caused by environmental factors such as infections, (rubeola and cytomegalovirus) . Nor can we exclude HL cases for being misclassified as feeble-minded in the church records. Previous reports of hearing loss in Sweden showed the highest figure, (13/10000) in the county of Västerbotten [36], almost identical to the figures from Finland , the highest in Europe [37]. More recent studies (81) support the high Västerbotten figures and the HL findings of Fig. 7 may be seen as a background.\n                Somewhat remarkable were the present findings of a deep HFE genealogy [2] upstream a Swedish river valley segregating with Wilson´s disease [10] and LQTS [11, 14] was also segregating with hearing loss caused by mutations in WHRN and TMC1 respectively.\n                        \n                The HFE mutation has, despite its young age, reached surprisingly high frequencies in North European iron poor areas [2–4, 6, 7] as predicted by Motulsky [38]. The lack of hepcidin giving homozygotes an increased capacity to absorb iron [4] might have been of selective advantage in an iron poor environment like the present Swedish ones [2, 39]. Whether the immune response genes in their HLA has contributed is hard to prove, but the haplotypes, A1B8 of the Fax river and A3B7 of the Fjällsjö river [2] are both very common, showing a striking relationship with HFE/p.C282Y through Europe [6].\n                A possible explanation to a selective advantages of HFE , LQTS and TMC1 is their presence in early colonizers (Figs. 1-4, 6-7 ) of the new Lapland habitat. As compared to individuals in the wake, the pioneers at a colonization front are said to be much more successful in passing their genes on to future generations through a mechanism of gene surfing [40]. Whether such a factor might have influenced the spread of the WHRN mutation seen in Fig. 5 is unclear. The family VI:1-2 of this pedigree consisted of 14 siblings of whom six (all females) reproduced, equal to an effective family size (EFS) of six. Three stayed and married in the local parish and got children with an average EFS of two (4+1+1), while three migrated into the new habitat and married colonizers (marked in red of Fig. 3). They got an average EFS of 7.7 (6+8+9) suggesting selective advantages. However, their success might also have been influenced by their marriage partners of past Finnish origin, from the first colonizers of Lapland well described by Richard Gothe [41]. Extensive genealogic studies seen in Figs. 6 and 7, suggest a possible Finnish origin of the TMC1 mutation. The founder AI A was born about 1570 in Äänekoski, a parish of central Finland. Our findings may be questioned because TMC1 has not been found among 6612 Finnish alleles tested in the Exome Aggregation (ExAC) database [42] in which 5 TMC1 alleles were found from Europe. However, our findings may be supported by the Finnish deaf mute statistics of 1912 (revised by Björkquist 1916 [43]) in which the parish of Äänekoski reported 11 (corresponding to 19/10000) HL individuals.\n                The first document of hearing loss in the new habitat is from an inspection of the church in Arsilla = Åsele in 1715 [44]. On the 23rd of December 1715 the inspector arrives in Hällan, the first village in Lapland at which he had to spend the night in the house of a colonizer who was “dumbe”= deaf mute. The next day he passes the village Gafsele and the house of the “Finncommissioner” until arrival in Åsele. There is genealogic evidence that the colonizer b 1655 is identical to IV:16 of Fig. 6 and the “Finncommissioner” identical to IV:18. The two are marked with arrows in Fig. 7.\n                Selective advantages was recently demonstrated in a similar upstream isolate of the Saguenay river, (SLSJ), of Quebec, Canada, in which deep human genealogies revealed a selective advantage to those on an expanding wave front [45]. The genetic footprints of these pioneers are still recognizable, and the HLA-A3B7 haplotype of the D 24 HFE family, also present in (SLSJ) [46], was recently attracted attention because of its presence in an Irish skeleton of the bronze age [47].\n                It may seem strange that a founder common to one disease (HH) is a common founder also of another disease. However this is not uncommon according to lessons from Quebec [48]. The findings of Hereditary hemochromatosis [2], Wilsons disease [10], LQTS [11, 14], and Hereditary hearing loss in the present study is therefore not unique.\n                Our pedigrees are small in number compared to the great French Canadian (SLSJ) findings [48], however this may be explained by the harder environmental conditions in Sweden north of N 63.9. While the upstream SLSJ today have a population of about 300.000 [48] less than 15000 live in the Swedish habitat (n = 12396, Statistics Sweden 2015).\n                One simple explanation for the survival and multiplication of the HFE mutation is its often mild phenotypic expression in homozygotes [49]. Even in those with a severe phenotype this comes late and does not interfere with reproduction. Two previous studies have been unable to prove reproductive advantage in hemochromatosis families [50, 51]. Whether the same would be seen in an iron poor environment as the present [2–4, 39], is unknown.\n                Somewhat surprising was the low frequency (22.2%) of HFE alleles (two p. C282Y, two p.H63D) in LQTS carriers. None was homozygous or showed compound heterozygosity.\n                Finally, recent studies using exome sequencing have shown that individuals can carry multiple recessive mutations as demonstrated in the Hutterites population [52]. In their study, some individuals could carry up to 5 recessive mutations and some could be homozygous for 3 different mutations . Our findings of two new recessive hearing loss mutations segregating with HFE [2], WND [10] and LQTS [11, 14] is therefore not remarkable, and is possible to reveal due to new technology now available.\n                Even if genealogic studies may be fascinating they are also time consuming. We would therefore recommend the use of information already assembled in genealogic registries. It is likely that some of the remaining 30% of the LQTS probands could have been attached [11]. Even if we agree that all blood lines are not conceived within wedlock [11], recent studies using Y-chromosome and genealogical data, have shown low historical rates of cuckoldry [53].\n              ConclusionsDeep human HFE genealogies show HFE to be associated with other genetic disorders like Wilson´s disease, LQTS, JLNS, and autosomal recessive hearing loss. Two new homozygous HL mutations in WHRN/p.S660Afs*30 and TMC1/p.L605P were identified,none of them previously reported from Scandinavia. The rarity of JLNS was possibly caused by miscarriage or intrauterine death. Most hearing loss (81.7%) was seen after 1844 when first cousin marriages were permitted. However, only 10 (10.3%) came from 1st cousin unions and only 2 (2.0 %) was born out of wedlock.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThe patients are gratefully acknowledged for their interest and assistance.

Seed shattering is a serious problem for E. sibiricus, especially at harvest time. Cross breeding is an effective way to create new varieties with beneficial characteristic or improved traits, and to broaden genetic base.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, we created five hybrid populations by crossing seven E. sibiricus genotypes that have seed shattering variation. Then, nine EST-SSR primers were used for hybrid identification based on DNA fingerprinting, and genetic diversity analysis of hybrid populations and their respective parents. A total of 15 hybrids were identified. An analysis of amplified polymorphic bands among genuine hybrids and their respective parents revealed mainly two types of markers: 1) hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in both parents; 2)hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in male parents. For each hybrid population, the total number of amplified bands ranged from 37 to 57, the percentage of polymorphism varied from 65.12% to 75.68%, with an average of 70.51%. Novel bands found in each hybrid population varied from 0 to 9 bands, suggesting an occurrence of rearrangements in the hybrid population. The structure analysis revealed that all hybrid populations and parents were assigned to eight groups. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed similar results.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                In general, this study proved EST-SSR markers are efficient for hybrid identification, and suggested more genetic variation could be captured in hybrid populations by crossing breeding.\n              Keywords\n                Elymus sibiricus\n              EST-SSR markerHybrid identificationGenetic diversityBackground\n                        Elymus sibiricus L., named also siberian wild rye, is a perennial, caespitose, gramineous Elymus forage grass [1], indigenous to Northern Asia [2]. Its natural geographic distribution extends from Sweden to Japan and even to parts of Alaska and Canada [3]. It is wildly utilized in cultivated pasture and natural grassland in north China, owing to its excellent tolerance to low temperature and drought, and good forage quality and palatability [4].In recent years, overgrazing and climate change resulted in grassland degeneration, it has created a need for revegetation/restoration of rangeland ecosystems in north China. As a native grass in north China, E.sibiricus have the potential to be used in degenerated grassland due to its good adaptability to local environment. However, few E.sibiricus cultivars are available for revegetation /restoration projects in these regions. Until now, progress in cultivar development and improvement in E.sibiricus has seriously lagged behind crop plants even other forage grasses. In the last 20 years, only 6 cultivars have been developed from wild materials [5]. Meanwhile, this species has serious problem with seed shattering. In previous study, we have identified some low seed shattering genotypes from wild E.sibiricus germplasm originated from northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau [4]. These materials are valuable genetic resources for seed shattering improvement in future breeding program. Cross breeding is an effective way to create new varieties with beneficial characteristic or improved traits, and to broaden genetic base of E. sibiricus [6]. Generally, these resynthesized breeding materials are genetically diverse from inbred line/cultivar [7], and might have higher heterosis than their parents [8]. Traditionally, we identify hybrids and analyze genetic diversity through morphological traits such as plant height, inflorescence, leaf shape, etc. The process of identification is time-consuming, and the accuracy of morphological identification is also limited due to the influence of environment factors. Compared to conventional hybrid identification through morphological difference in the course of plant breeding, marker-assisted selection (MAS) is more efficient way as it is reproducible, reliable, and independent from environmental conditions, it therefore could be used to mirror directly genetic diversity [9].Among the available molecular markers, SSRs (simple sequence repeats) or microsatellites, offer an important DNA marker system for hybrid purity testing because of their co-dominance, reproducibility, robustness, and multi-allelic nature [10]. The characteristics of co-dominance give enormous advantages to SSR marker, which can be more clearly to present the band feature of parent plant and their offspring in plant breeding [11]. SSR markers have been widely used to assess hybrid purity in maize [12], rice [13], sunflower [14], cabbage [15], bunching onion [16], cauliflower [17] and some forage grasses like orchardgrass [18]. In addition, SSR markers have been successfully used to distinguish E. sibiricus and E. nutans originated from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau [19] and detect genetic diversity and variation of E. sibiricus accessions worldwide [20]. There are no previous reports of hybrid identification using EST-SSR markers. Genetic information on hybrid populations is limited in E.sibiricus.In this study, we used EST-SSR markers to identify hybrid based on specially amplified DNA fingerprinting and analyze genetic diversity of five hybrid populations and their respective parents in E. sibiricus. This study will help lay a foundation for future E. sibiricus breeding program.MethodsPlant materials\n                A total of seven E. sibiricus accessions and their offsprings were used in this study (Tables 1 and 2). These seven accessions had different geographical origins, they were genetically and morphological divergent. According to previous genetic diversity study these accessions were clustered to different groups based on SCoT markers [20]. In addition, their selection was also based primarily on several contrasting agronomic traits: seed shattering, plant height, panicle length, etc. E. sibiricus is not an endangered or protected species, thus, no permission was required for collecting these samples in China. Single genotype from each parental accession was used to generate the F1 hybrids by hand pollination in June 2014. A total of 15 F1 individuals were derived from five pairs of cross (Table 2). F1 seeds were harvested from the female parents in August 2014. The F1 individuals were grown in a greenhouse at approximately 22 °C and a 16 h photoperiod until they were 8 weeks old. The F1 individuals were then transplanted to the field in the campus experimental station at Lanzhou University, Yuzhong, Gansu, China (103°34' E, 35°34' N). No any permissions were required to carry out field experiment. A total of 15 F1 plants were tested by EST-SSR markers to confirm their hybrid status.Table 1\n                        The origin and morphological traits of parents used in this study\n                      ParentsStatusOriginMorphological characteristicsY1005-1WildRuo ergai, Sichuan, ChinaHigh seed shatteringLQ03-1WildLuqu, Gansu, ChinaMedium seed shatteringPI 348916WildAlaska, United StateLow seed shattering, Late floweringXH09-4WildXiahe, Gansu, ChinaHigh seed shatteringZhN06-1WildZhuoni, Gansu, ChinaLow seed shatteringZhN06-11WildZhuoni, Gansu, ChinaLow seed shattering, tall, long panicleChuancao No. 2CultivarHongyuan, Sichuan, ChinaTall, early flowering, medium seed shatteringTable 2\n                        Parents and hybrid populations used in this study\n                      PopulationFemale parentsMale parentsF1 individuals1ZhN06-1Y1005-11-H12Y1005-1ZhN06-112-H2, 2-H3, 2-H4, 2-H53ZhN06-11Y1005-13-H1, 3-H2 3-H3, 3-H4, 3-H54XH09-4LQ03-14-H1, 4-H2, 4-H35Chuancao No. 2PI3489165-H1, 5-H2\n              DNA extraction and PCR amplification\n                Genomic DNA was extracted from parental plants and individual hybrid plant tissue using SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) method [21] (Shan et al., 2011). DNA quantity and quality were verified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Products, Wilmington, DE, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis. Finally, the DNA concentration was adjusted with ddH2O to 25 ng/µL and stored at -20 °C prior to PCR amplification. A total of nine selected polymorphic EST-SSR primers were used for genotyping (Table 3). These primers had been used in a previous genetic diversity study in E. sibiricus [4]. The optimal reaction system for E.sibiricus was as follows: 2 µL 25 ng/µL DNA, 7.5 µL 2× Reaction Mix (Tiangen Beijing, China), 0.5 µL 10 µM forward primer, 0.5 µL 10 µM reverse primer, 0.2 µL (2.5 U/µL) Golden DNA Polymerase (Tiangen Beijing, China), and 4.3 µL of sterile ddH2O in a total of 15 µL reaction volume. PCR amplification was carried out as described by Xie et al. [4]. Then amplification fragments were separated on 6% denatured polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained by AgNO3 solution. Then gel was photographed by a Gel Doc (TM) XY System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).Table 3\n                        The 9 EST-SSR primers used in this study\n                      Primer nameForward primersReverse primersElw1420s081GGATAGACCCATGAGCTGACTGATCTTTCTCCACAAGTTGAACACAACAElw3545s194CAGCACTAGTATCCACCTCCACCTTGTTACAGCCTCTTCAGGCTCTTCElw5627s404AGATGAAGCTGGTAACCGAGACAGATTTCCTCTAATGGAAGCTCTGGCPs1830GACTCGGCGAAAGGACTCTCTCTCGACGTCCTTCATGAGCTTPs2283GCCACAACAAGAGAAGACCTTGCGACCTGCATGATGCTCTCGCPs3577CATCTTGCATATAGCTCCTTCGCTCTCAAGAAACCCACAATCCAATTCPs938TTGCTCCTATGGTTCCACGTAGTTAAAGTGAAATTCTGCCATCAGAGCLtc0055AAGAAGAAGAGGCCGAGGAATAAACGTGGATGTGCTGCAGGTAGTALtc0157GCAATGAACACTGAATCAATCGAGCGTGTGAGACTCATCGATGTTACC\n              Data analysis\n                The amplified bands were scored as present (1) or absent (0), and only reproducible bands were considered. STRUCTURE v2.3.4 software was used to analyze the population structure of E. sibiricus accessions and hybrid populations, with the 'admixture mode', burn-in period of 10,000 iterations and a run of 100,000 replications of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) after burn in [22]. For each run, 10 independent runs of STRUCTURE were performed with the number of clusters (K) varying from 1 to 8. Mean L (K) and delta K (<U+0394>K) were estimated using the method described by Evanno et al. [23] To detect genetic relationship among different accessions, a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was constructed based on Jaccard's genetic similarity matrix using DCENTER module in NTSYS (version 2.10), which is more informative regarding distances among major groups [24]. E. sibiricus hybrid identification was carried out according to a method used in orchardgrass [18]. Single primer pairs or primer combinations that were diagnostic for parental plants and hybrid plants were used.\n              ResultsEST-SSR marker transferability\n                EST-SSR markers previously developed from Snake River wheatgrass (Elymus wawawaiensis), thick spike wheatgrass (Elymus lanceolatusd), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegeneria spicata) and Leymus species were used in this study. Finally, a total of 9 primers were selected and used for hybrid identification and genetic diversity analysis, of which 3 from Elymus (Elw hereafter), 4 from Pseudoroegneria (Ps hereafter) and 2 from Leymus (Lt hereafter). The results proved that all 9 primers can be successfully amplified across 22 E.sibiricus plants used in this study, with 100% the transferability rate.\n              Hybrid identification\n                Single primers or primer combinations that were diagnostic for parental plants and hybrid plants were used. In the study, an analysis of amplified polymorphic bands among genuine hybrids and their respective parents mainly revealed two types of markers: 1) hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in both parents (Fig. 1a); 2) hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in male parents (Fig. 1b); Finally, according to this method, 15 hybrids were successfully identified using different primers and then used for the genetic diversity analysis (Table 2).\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        EST-SSR profiles produced with different primers in hybrid and their respective parents. a: hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in both parents; b hybrids shared bands exclusively amplified in male parents\n                      \n              EST-SSR polymorphism and genetic relationship in hybrid populations and parents\n                In this study, 9 primers were used for genetic diversity analysis among five hybrid populations and their parents (Table 4).

The percentages in the first three populations didn’t reach 50%. For example, in the population 1, 32.43% were inherited from ZhN06-1 and 32.43% were from Y1005-1. In the population 2, 47.37% were from ZhN06-11 and Y1005-1 had 42.11% origin. In the population 3, 38.59% were inherited from male parent and 35.09% from female parent. However, in the population 4 and 5, 56.09% and 55.81% amplified bands were inherited from male parents, respectively. Some types of polymorphism evidenced an occurrence of rearrangements in the hybrid populations that resulted from the gain of novel bands (not seen in parental genomes). Total number of bands that exclusively present in hybrid populations ranged from 0 (Pop4) to 9 (Pop2), with an average of 6.2.\n                The population structure of hybrid populations and their parents was analyzed in this study. Based on maximum likelihood and delta K (<U+0394>K) values, the number of optimum groups was eight (Fig. 2). All accessions were assigned to eight groups. group1 included LQ03-1, 1-H1, 2-H2, 2-H3, 2-H5; group 2: PI348916, 2-H4, 3-H4, 3-H5; group 3: ZhN06-11, 3-H1, 3-H2; group 4: 4-H2, 4-H3; group 5: 3-H3; group 6: ZhN06-1, Chuancao No.2, 5-H1, 5-H2; group 7: XH09-4, 4-H1; group 8: Y1005-1. Every group was mixed genetic ingredient of other groups in different extent. Especially, LQ03-1, PI348916, ZhN06-11, 3-H3, 1-H1 and 2-H5 had more complicated genetic constitutes than the other accessions in the study. 1-H1, 2-H5 and 3-H3 were the F1 individuals from population 1, 2 and 3, respectively. However, some accessions presented a purer genetic ingredient within their groups. 4-H1, 5-H1 and 5-H2, the F1 plant of population 4 and 5, had same genetic constitutes to female XH09-4 and Chuancao No.2 respectively. The rest of individuals for pure genetic constitutes included 2-H2, 2-H3, 2-H4, 3-H1, 3-H2 and 3-H5, they came from population 2 and 3.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Eight groups of 22 E. sibiricus accessions inferred from STRUCTURE analysis and the description of detected the optimum value of K by using graphical method. a Mean L (K) over 20 runs for each K value; b Maximum delta K (4 K) values were used to determine the uppermost level of structure for K ranging from 2 to 10, here K is 8 and eight clusters; c The vertical coordinate of each group indicates the membership coefficients for each accession. 1-22 represented respectively: ZhN06-1, Y1005-1, 1-H1, Chuancao No.2, PI348916, 5-H1, 5-H2, ZhN06-11, 3-H1, 2-H2, 3-H2, 3-H3, 2-H3, XH09-4, LQ03-1, 4-H1, 4-H2, 4-H3, 2-H4, 3-H4, 3-H5, 2-H5\n                      \n                The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed about 64.72% of the total variation was described by the first three PCo (Fig. 3). The results of PCoA analysis were similar to structure analysis.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Principal coordinates analysis for EST-SSR markers using genetic similarity matrix for 22 E. sibiricus accessions.

But environmental factors often affect the accuracy of identification. DNA fingerprinting techniques are efficient alternatives to morphological identification, and make plant identification easy and accurate. Molecular markers have been successfully applied to identification of crop and forage grass species [25, 26]. EST-SSRs are codominant markers that can show evidently the heterozygosity of offspring populations by the bands from parents and hybrid plants [10, 27]. Our study is the first report of E. sibiricus hybrids identification using EST-SSR markers. Based on our results single primers or primer combinations that were diagnostic for parental plants and hybrid plants could be used for hybrid identification. Fifteen hybrids were identified with two types of DNA fingerprinting. In general, this study demonstrated that EST-SSR markers can effectively identify E.sibiricus hybrids through special DNA fingerprinting profiles. This study will lay a foundation for E. sibiricus breeding in future.\n              EST-SSR marker for genetic diversity in E. sibiricus\n                        \n                EST-SSRs are highly polymorphic, abundant and are accessible to research laboratories via published primers sequences [4]. These published primers are especially important resources for species like E. sibiriucs with few molecular markers available. In this study, a total of 9 EST-SSR markers from three different genuses were used for hybrid identification and genetic diversity analysis. The transferability rate of EST-SSRs was 100%. Results of this study were consistent with previous reports that EST-SSR markers have high transferability rate among species. Information on genetic diversity and hybrid population and their parents can improve our understanding of breeding materials.Based on our results the percentage of polymorphism varied from 65.12 (Pop 5) to 75.68% (Pop 1), with an average of 70.51%. The average percentage of polymorphism (PPB) of five hybrid populations were lower than previous reports of SRAP (PPB<U+2009>=<U+2009>86.5%) [28], SSR (PPB<U+2009>=<U+2009>89.4%) [4], and SCoT (PPB<U+2009>=<U+2009>91.9%) [29]. The major reason for relatively low PPB could be small sample size of each population. In addition, hybrid populations derived from seven parent genotypes, and genetic base was relatively narrow. This can be supported by results of structure analysis. In general, these accessions and their offspring did not show major genetic structure, most of accessions were assigned into mixed groups, indicating relatively narrow genetic base.\n              Broadening genetic diversity for breeding\n                In this study, some types of polymorphism have evidenced potentially an occurrence of chromosome variation or gene rearrangements in hybrid populations that resulted from the gain of novel bands. The results of the present study suggested that more genetic diversity and new variation could be captured by crossing breeding. Whether these novel bands were responsible to new genes associated to seed shattering or other important traits, it was still not clear. It is still difficult to address particular mechanisms understanding the chromosomal or genomic rearrangements in response to novel bands. In the future, molecular markers combined with sequence data might provide evidence to the inheritance of transcribed regions and gene functions.\n              Abbreviations\n                EF1: \n                    Bands exclusively present in hybrids\n                  FF1: \n                    Bands shared by female parents and hybrids\n                  M: \n                    Number of monomorphic bands\n                  MF1: \n                    Bands shared by male parents and hybrids\n                  PCoA: \n                    Principal coordinate analysis\n                  PPB: \n                    Percentage of polymorphic bands\n                  T: \n                    Total number of amplified bands\n                  TP: \n                    Total number of polymorphic bands\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe thanks grants from the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT-17R50), Chinese National Basic Research Program (973 Program) (No. 2014CB138704), the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems, 111 program (B12002).\n                Funding\n                This study was supported by grants from the Chinese National Basic Research Program (973 Program) (No. 2014CB138704), the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-ecosystems, 111 program (B12002).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                The data supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article.\n              Authors’ contributionsWX, YW conceived and designed the experiments.

Yet, there is limited information about switchgrass DREB genes and their functional roles.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, four cold-inducible PvDREB1s were identified from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), among which PvDREB1C was the one responded to cold stress later than the other three PvDREB1s. Yet, ectopic overexpression of PvDREB1C led to significantly compromised, instead of improved cold tolerance in transgenic tobacco. On the other hand, PvDREB1C was transcriptionally down-regulated in response to salt stress, but overexpression of PvDREB1C improved plant salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco. The improved salt tolerance was associated with increased K+/Na+ ratio and Ca2+ content, higher cellular osmotic potential, and activation of stress-related functional genes in the leaves of transgenic plants under salt stress.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The current results implied that PvDREB1C played opposite roles in plant cold and salt tolerance. Although DREB1s were known as positive stress regulators, particular attentions shall be paid to their potential negative regulatory role(s).\n              KeywordsSwitchgrassDREB/CBFDual functionColdSaltStressBackgroundSwitchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a perennial, C4 tall grass used for biofuel and forage feedstock production, water and soil conservation, as well as habitat restoration [1–3]. Switchgrass is known for its wide adaptation to diverse and relatively harsh environment [4]. However, genetic improvement of switchgrass is highly desirable to successfully establish switchgrass in marginal lands with minimal biomass sacrifice and little cost of resource and labor inputs.The C-repeat-binding factors/DRE-binding factors (CBF/DREBs) constitute an indispensable regulatory network for plant tolerance against abiotic stresses (e.g. cold, drought and salinity, etc.) [5]. DREBs primarily function through transactivating the expression of downstream functional genes through binding to the C-repeat/dehydration responsive (CRT/DRE) cis-elements [6]. Previous studies revealed that CBFs play important roles in plant cold tolerance through the IEC1-CBF regulon to activate the expression of downstream cold-responsive genes [7]. CBF/DREBs (e.g. OsDREB1D and OsDREB1F) were also reported to positively regulate plant salt and drought tolerances [8, 9]. Despite the importance of DREB family genes in plant stress tolerance, there is limited information about switchgrass DREB genes and their functional roles.The objective of this study was to analyze the biological function of a DREB1 gene for its potential use in switchgrass genetic improvement. The cloned switchgrass DREB1C was up-regulated by cold stress but down-regulated by salt and osmotic stress. Yet, over-expression of PvDREB1C in transgenic tobacco led to compromised cold tolerance, but improved salt tolerance with lower Na+/K+ ratio and higher reactive oxygen scavenging enzyme activities under salt stress.ResultsFour switchgrass DREB1 genes transcriptionally responsive to cold exposure\n                In searching for CBFs/DREB1s involved in cold tolerance in switchgrass, four rice cold-responsive DREB1s [i.e. OsDREB1A (Os09g0522200), OsDREB1B (Os09g0522000), OsDREB1C (Os06g0127100), OsDREB1G (Os02g0677300) [10, 11] were used to search corresponding orthologs against the switchgrass genome database (Panicum virgatum v1.1, DOE-JGI) using BLAST. Seven orthologous switchgrass PvDREB1s were found according to their corresponding orthologous genes in rice. According to the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1a), these PvDREB1s were named as PvDREB1A-1/-2 (Pavir.J03891.1 & Pavir.Ba01280.1), PvDREB1B-1/-2 (Pavir.J19655.1 & Pavir.Ba01283.1), PvDREB1C (Pavir.J35991.1), and PvDREB1G-1/-2 (Pavir.Ab02685.1 & Pavir.Aa00912.1). Switchgrass ‘Alamo’ is an allotetraploid with two closely related chromosomal sets [12, 13]. PvDREB1G-1 and -2 were paralogous genes in corresponding homeologous chromosomes 1b and 1a, respectively (switchgrass genome from JGI: Panicum virgatum v4.1). Although the chromosome locations of PvDREB1A-1and PvDREB1B-2 were not determined yet, these two paired PvDREB1s were likely derived from the allotetraploidy event of switchgrass as well [12, 13].\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Phylogenetic analysis and relative expression of four cold-inducible PvDREB1s. a The Neighbor-Joining tree was built using MEGA6 software. The optimal tree is drawn to scale, with the sum of branch length = 1.99584622 is shown. b-e Expression of DREB1s in response to low temperature (4 °C). f-g \n                                       PvDREB1C was transcriptionally suppressed by 250 mM NaCl or PEG-6000 (20%, W/V). Data are represented as mean ± SE (n = 3), and different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P < 0.05\n                      \n                To verify whether these PvDREB1s were cold-inducible genes, we exposed non-acclimatized switchgrass to 4 °C. The three paired genes shared highly similar nucleotide sequence identity that the paired genes could not be discriminated from each other using real-time PCR. Therefore, the detected transcript levels of PvDREB1A, PvDREB1B, or PvDREB1G should be the combination of their respective paralogous genes (e.g. the detected transcript level of PvDREB1A should be comprised of both PvDREB1A-1 and PvDREB1A-2 as shown in Fig. 1). As predicated, these four PvDREB1s all responded to low temperature treatment, yet their expression patterns differed. PvDREB1A and PvDREB1G were quickly induced by the cold treatment that their transcripts dramatically increased over 100 times within 0.5 h and reached its peak level after 1 or 4 h respectively. The expression level of PvDREB1B quickly decreased after 0.5 h of cold treatment, then slowly increased and reached its peak after 4 h.\n                \n                           PvDREB1C was the one responded relatively late to cold treatment, and its transcripts accumulated after 2 h- of treatment, reached its peak after 4 h and decreased thereafter. In particular, PvDREB1C was also transcriptionally suppressed by NaCl and drought treatments within 0.5 h and decreased to its lowest level 2–4 h after the corresponding stress treatment (Fig. 1f, g). Since most DREB1s genes were transcriptionally up-regulated in response to abiotic stresses [5], it was uncommon to see that the transcription of PvDREB1C was decreased under salt and drought stresses. Therefore, the function of PvDREB1C was further investigated.\n              Ectopic overexpression of PvDREB1C in tobacco negatively affected its tolerance against cold stress\n                Stable transgenic tobacco plants were generated to further characterize the function of PvDREB1C. As shown in Fig. 2, three transgenic lines with varied expression levels of PvDREB1C were used for analysis. These transgenic plants did not show apparent phenotypic alterations compared to wildtype (WT) plants under the optimum condition. However, the transgenic plants showed higher electrolyte leakage (EL) rates under chilling stress (4 °C) (Fig. 3a), and had significantly lower survival rates than those of WT when exposed to freezing stress (-4 °C) (Fig. 3b-c), demonstrating that over-expression of PvDREB1C led to compromised cold tolerance.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Verification of transgenic lines used in this study. a T2 seeds germinated in selective medium containing 15 mg·L-1 bialaphos. b Relative expression of the transgene, PvDREB1C, in three transgenic lines.

Unchanged drought tolerance was observed with the transgenic plants (data not shown), while significantly improved salt tolerance was recorded. As shown in Fig. 4, the transgenic plants had significantly bigger plant sizes with higher fresh weight (FW) and plant height than those of the WT after 25 days of salt treatment by watering with 200 mM NaCl.\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Transgenic PvDREB1C tobacco showed improved tolerance to salt stress. a-c The PvDREB1C transgenic plants showed better performance after 25 days of 200 mM NaCl treatment: phenotypes a, fresh weight b and plant height c of transgenic and wildtype plants.

Both phases were checked at physiological and gene expression levels comparing the transgenic with the WT plants. Without salt treatment, the transgenic plants had comparable contents of Na+ and K+ in both leaves and roots with the WT plants; under salt stress, the transgenic plants demonstrated significantly less Na+ contents and Na+/K+, and higher Ca2+ contents in leaves but not in roots (Fig. 5), suggesting that overexpressing PvDREB1C altered the sodium transportation from root to shoot.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Contents of Na+, K+ and Ca2+, and ratios between Na+ and K+in leaves a-d or in roots e-h.

And the qRT-PCR results showed that relative expression levels of one Na+/K+ transporter gene (NtNHX4), two ROS-scavenging enzyme genes (NtSOD &NtPOD), and a dehydrin-encoding gene (NtERD10B) were significantly higher in the transgenic plant than those in the WT under salt stress, while those of NtSOS1, NtcAPX, NtPAO, and NtCuAO2 were largely unchanged.\n                      \n                    Fig. 7\n                        Transcriptional changes of downstream functional genes encoding for ion transporters a, b, ROS-scavenging enzymes c-f, dehydrin and polyamines g-j.

The presence of at least one ACCGAC DRE cis-element in -2Kb promoter regions of NtSOD, NtPOD, and NtERD10B were identified (see Additional file 1), suggesting that these genes were among the direct target genes of PvDREB1C. To further understand the binding preference of PvDREB1C to the two types of DRE cis-elements, we generated mutant rd29A promoters with one ACCGAC and four GCCGAC (rd29Apro-1A4G), or with five GCCGAC but no ACCGAC (rd29Apro-0A5G) as illustrated in Fig. 8 (sequences presented in Additional file 1).

In most cases, positive regulatory roles of CBF/DREB1 in plant abiotic stresses were documented [15], and their biological functions were often positively associated with their transcriptional responses to abiotic stresses, such as DREB1A/CBF3 & DREB1B/CBF1 in Arabidopsis [6, 16], and OsDREB1A [11] and OsDREB1B [17] in rice. One exception was CBF2/DREB1C in Arabidopsis, which suppressed CBF1 & CBF3 and thereby negatively affected plant cold tolerance [18]. Yet, overexpressing the Arabidopsis DREB1C improved plant drought tolerance [19], suggesting that CBF2/DREB1C played opposite roles in orchestrating plant tolerance against cold and drought stresses. In this study, we initially identified PvDREB1C as a cold-inducible gene, but found that overexpressing PvDREB1C lead to compromised plant cold tolerance, unchanged drought tolerance and improved salt-tolerance, suggesting that both PvDREB1C and Arabidopsis DREB1C had opposite functions in regulating plant tolerance against different types of abiotic stress. Although DREB1s were known as positive stress regulators, particular attentions shall be paid to their potential negative regulatory role(s).Plants employ different strategies to cope with cold and salt stresses. Yet, crosstalk between these abiotic stress responses via common signaling molecules (e.g. ABA and Ca2+) or pathways was recorded [20]. Chilling (above 0 °C) primarily causes the damage of cell membrane system, inhibition of photosynthesis as well as oxidative stress, while freezing (below 0 °C) exerts additional mechanical damage due to the formation of ice crystals within cells or in intercellular spaces [21]. At the molecular level, cold is sensed by membrane proteins such as COLD1, leading to cytosolic Ca2+ signal to activate MAP kinase cascade, that phosphorylate transcription factors (e.g. ICE1) [22, 23], and the activated ICE1 rapidly induces the expression of CBF/DREB1s to trans-activate the expression of downstream cold-responsive genes [7]. Ca2+ signal also play important roles in plant salt stress tolerance: Na+ stress triggers cytosolic Ca2+-signal to activate SOS3 (in roots) or SCaBP8/CBL10 (in shoots) that interact with and activate a kinase, SOS2. The activated SOS2 phosphorylates and activates SOS1, a Na+/H + antiporter at the plasma membrane to pump Na+ out of cells, thus restoring ion homeostasis [20]. Another set of Na+/H+ antiporters (NHXs) locate in vacuole membrane to facilitate Na+ compartmentalization and maintain intracellular K+ status [20]. CBF/DREB1s were also reported to be involved in plant salt tolerance as well. For example, overexpressing OsDREB1D and OsDREB1F improved plant salt tolerance in rice and/or Arabidopsis possibly by targeting genes involved in ionic and osmotic regulations [8, 9].The PvDREB1C transgenic plants had significantly higher Ca2+ contents in leaves but not in roots, and Ca2+ activated the Na+/H + antiporters to exclude Na+ from leaf cells, thereby reduced the ionic damage caused by Na+ on the transgenic plants. At the transcription level, overexpressing PvDREB1C activated the expression of NtNHX4 which was involved in Na+ compartmentalization [20], but not the expression of NtSOS1 which was responsible for pumping Na+ out of the cell [20]. The low Na+/K+ ratio in leaves of transgenic plants was probably due to altered expression of SOS genes in below-ground organs rather than in leaves which needs further investigation in the future. On the other hand, the PvDREB1C plants also had higher osmotic potential and less H2O2 accumulation, suggesting that PvDREB1C also functioned in activating osmotic-regulation and ROS-scavenging systems under salt stress [14]. Yet, when subjected to chilling stress, the transgenic lines had higher EL suggesting that their plasma membranes were more vulnerable to cold. The exact reason behind that difference needs to be further investigated in the future (e.g. by understanding the full picture of its downstream target gene networks).Different DREBs have preference to the specific sequences of the core DRE cis-element. For examples, the rice CBF3/DREB1A bound to GCCGAC more preferentially than to ACCGAC, whereas the Arabidopsis CBF3/DREB1A could efficiently bind to both GCCGAC and ACCGAC [11]. Flanking sequences of the DRE/CRT might also affect the binding efficiency of DREBs. For example, Maruyama et al. [24] found that CBF3 bounds to A/GCCGACNT more efficiently than to A/GCCGACNA/G/C. Among the 302 inducible genes by low temperature in the wildtype Arabidopsis, 85 of them were induced by CBF2/DREB1C in transgenic Arabidopsis under normal growth temperature [25]. The rd29A promoter has five conserved DRE cis-elements [26]. In this study, the conversion of ACCGAC to GCCGAC of the third upstream core DRE cis-element of rd29A promoter nearly abolished the transcriptional activation of PvDREB1C. Furthermore, among the four up-regulated downstream functional genes in PvDREB1C transgenic plants under salt stress, three of their -2 Kb promoter regions (NtSOD, NtPOD, and NtERD10B) contain at least one ACCGAC sequences (see Additional file 1). Together, this result suggested that PvDREB1C preferentially activated those promoters with the core DRE cis-element of ACCGAC. Such information shall be useful for understanding the full picture of its downstream target gene networks using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches in the future.ConclusionsIt is inevitable to grow switchgrass in barren, saline and other types of marginal land for the purposes of biofuel and forage feedstock crop production and water and soil conservation. The current results showed that PvDREB1C played opposite roles in cold and salt tolerance, and supported that PvDREB1C could be used for improving switchgrass salt tolerance, but particular attentions shall be paid to its negative role in cold tolerance.MethodsPlant materials\n                Switchgrass line ‘HR8’ [27] selected from the ecotype ‘Alamo’ was used to study the PvDREB1s expression levels. The plant growth condition was the same as previously reported with a 14 h photoperiod and the growth temperature set at 30/20 ± 3 °C (day/night) [28].\n                The tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana) plants were grown in pots with peat soil, and were maintained in growth chambers set at 23/20 °C (day/night) with a 12 h photoperiod and photoactive radiation of 350 µmol photons m-2·s-1 for 4 weeks.\n              Gene cloning and vector construction\n                Putative cold-inducible DREB1 (PvDREB1s) genes were pooled out from the switchgrass genome database (Panicum virgatum v1.1, DOE-JGI) that were homologous to four rice cold-responsive OsDREB1 genes. These PvDREB1s were named as DREB1A-1 (Pavir.J03891.1), DREB1A-2 (Pavir.Ba01280.1), DREB1B-1 (Pavir.J19655.1), DREB1B-2 (Pavir.Ba01283.1), DREB1C (Pavir.J35991.1), DREB1G-1 (Pavir.Ab02685.1), DREB1G-2 (Pavir.Aa00912.1) and were amplified by PCR using the Q5 PCR mix (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) with the annealing temperature set at 61 °C for 30 amplification cycles. The gene was cloned into an entry vector and then to the plant expression vector pEarlyGate103 [29].\n                The pCAMBIA1302-Pro:GUS-polyA vector was constructed for promoter analysis. In brief, the GUS-polyA fragment was amplified by PCR from the pCAMBIA1305.1 vector with the flanking PstI & HindIII sites, cloned into pENTR/D vector, and sequenced. Then the fragment was inserted into the corresponding restriction enzyme sites of pCAMBIA1302. The resultant pCambia1302-Pro:GUS-polyA vector has a number of restriction enzyme sites (EcoRI – SacI – KpnI – XbaI – SalI - PstI) upstream of the GUS (UidA) gene for the insertion of target promoter.\n                The rd29A (AT5G52310) promoter was cloned from Arabidopsis ecotype ‘Columbia’, and sequenced. Mutations were introduced into the DRE/CRT cis-element to result in A/GCCGAC (sequences as shown in data S1). These five promoters were sub-cloned into the EcoRI & KpnI sites of pCAMBIA1302-Pro:GUS-polyA.\n              Switchgrass stress treatment and qRT-PCR analysis\n                The switchgrass plantlets at the height of ~30 cm were used for the following treatments. In brief, three fully expanded leaves (the 3rd leaves from the top) from different plantlets were pooled as one sample, and the sampling time were set at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after cold (4 °C), 20% PEG, or 250 mM NaCl treatment, respectively.\n                The total RNA was isolated from switchgrass leaves using RNApure fast isolation Kit (YuanPingHao, Tianjin, China). The first strand cDNA was synthesized with 1 µg RNA using the PrimeScriptRT Reagent Kit after the removal of gDNA (Takara, Dalian, China). The qRT-PCR was performed on a Roche LightCycler480 II machine (Roche Diagnostic, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) using the SYBR Green I Master Reaction System (Roche Diagnostic). The PCR condition was set as follows: 10 min at 95 °C for initial denaturation, and 40 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s). Three biological replicates and two technical replicates were performed. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method with PvFTSH4 as a reference gene [30]. The qRT-PCR primers used in this study were shown in Table 1.Table 1\n                        Primers used in this study\n                      Primer setsNCBI Accession No. for the target genePrimer Sequence (5'-3'))Purpose\n                              PvDREB1C_CDS\n                            Pavir.J35991.1ATACGGATCATGGAGTACGACGAGCAGGAGCloning of PvDREB1C\n                                          TGATAAGCTTGTCGTAGTAGCTCCACAGCGTC\n                              35S_F1 & GFP_R1\n                            –TCCACTGACGTAAGGGATGACPCR verification of transgenic tobaccoAGAATTGGGACAACTCCAGTG\n                              PvDREB1C_qRT\n                            Pavir.J35991.1GGAGTACGACGAGCAGGAGTqRT-PCRGGTCTCCCGGAACTTGGT\n                              NtSOD\n                            AB093097AGCTACATGACGCCATTTCCqRT-PCRCCCTGTAAAGCAGCACCTTC\n                              NtPOD\n                            D11396.1GCTGTTCGACGAGTTGTTAACAGqRT-PCRCTCTGGCTGAGTTGTTGTTGG\n                              NtAPX1\n                            AU15933CAAATGTAAGAGGAAACTCAGAGGAqRT-PCRCAGCCTTGAGCCTCATGGTACCG\n                              NtcAPX\n                            D85912CTGGAGTTGTTGCTGTTGqRT-PCRGGTGGCTCTGTCTTGTC\n                              NtNHX4\n                            XM_016617731CAAGAACTTCCGCACCCACqRT-PCRGCAGTATCAAACGCAGAGGACC\n                              NtSOS1\n                            XM_016611194CAAATGTTATCCCCCGAAAGCqRT-PCRCGGAGAACCTGAGGAAATGTGA\n                              NtERD10B\n                            AB049336CAATTTAGTGCAGGCCAGGCqRT-PCRGGTCCATGGTGGCCAGGAAG\n                              NtPAO\n                            AB200262GCTGCTCTGTCGTCATAqRT-PCRTATCCTGCCACCTATCTTATC\n                              NtCuAO1\n                            DQ873385TATGGCAGTTGATTGTAAGCqRT-PCRTGACGAGCAGAGAATGG\n                              NtCuAO2\n                            AB289457TATGGCAGTTGATTGTAAGCqRT-PCRCCAATGACGAGCAGATAAAGT\n                              NtUbiquitin\n                            XM_016580871TCCAGGACAAGGAGGGTATqRT-PCRCATCAACAACAGGCAACCTAG\n              Tobacco genetic transformation and transient assay\n                All binary vectors used in this study were electro-transformed into the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain ‘AGL1’. The genetic transformation of tobacco was conducted as previously described [31]. The transgenic plants were screened by 15 mg·L-1 bialaphos and the regenerated plants, once rooted in soil, were verified by PCR.\n                The relative binding efficiency of PvDREB1C to the above described five rd29A promotors was tested using a transient assay method on mature leaves of 4-week-old N. benthamina plants. In brief, pEarleyGate103-PvDREB1c/AGL1 and pCAMBIA1302-RD29A_Pro: GUS-polyA/AGL1 were mixed together, and co-injected into tobacco leaves. The amount of injected solution was measured using a labelled syringe and was kept the same for all treatments. The empty vector, pCAMBIA1302-Pro:GUS-polyA without any promoter upstream of the UidA (GUS) gene, was used as the negative control. Leaves injected with the infection solution (1/2 MS, 3% sucrose and 100 µM acetosyringone, pH 5.7) were used as background controls. Each testing point was measured with 15 biological replicates. After 24 h, the injected leaves were sampled and measured for GUS activity using a method as described by Fior et al. [32].\n              Evaluation of transgenic plants exposed to low temperature and salt stress\n                One and a half month old T2 transgenic and wildtype tobaccos were grown in pots and used for cold and freezing tolerance analysis: (1) for 4 °C cold tolerance, 18 plants of each line were moved into one growth chamber with temperature set at 4 °C and under light of 200 µmol photon m-2 s-1 for 24 h; (2) for freezing tolerance, another batch of tobacco plants (18 plants of each line) were moved to the growth chamber with temperature gradually decreased to -4 °C (lowering two degrees per hour starting from 4 °C), and maintained at -4 °C for 3 h. The plants were then moved back to optimum growth condition and their survival rates were counted after recovery for 2 d [33].\n                T2 transgenic plants were used for the salt tolerance. One and a half month old tobacco plants grown in pots were also used for salt tolerance assessment by watering with 200 mM NaCl for 25 days. Plants normally watered were used as controls.\n              Measurement of physiological parameters\n                Electrolyte leakage\n                  The leaf electrolyte leakage (EL) was measured according to Jiang and Huang [34]. In brief, leaves at the same positions were detached and incubated in 30 ml distilled deionized water. The initial level of EL (Ci) was measured using a conductance meter (Thermo Scientific, Baverly, USA) after shaken for 24 h at room temperature. The leaf tissue was then killed in an autoclave at 121 °C for 30 min, and incubated for 24 h on a shaker for measuring the maximum conductance (Cmax) of the incubation solution. Relative EL was calculated as EL = (Ci/Cmax) × 100.\n                Osmotic potential\n                  Osmatic potential was measured using an osmatic potential determinator Vapro Model 5520 (Wescor, Logan, Utah). The leaf tissue was soaked in distilled water for 6 h, then in liquid nitrogen for 1 min, and on ice for another 30 min. Finally, the leaves were ground into juice for measurement.\n                H2O2 content\n                  The H2O2 content was measured according to Sergiev [35]. In brief, seedlings were extracted with 2 ml cold 5% (w/v) TCA. The extraction was then centrifuged at 12,054 g for 15 min. The 0.5 ml supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) and 1 ml KI (1 M), and then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 390 nm and the concentration of H2O2 was calculated against the standard curve.\n                SOD, POD and APX activities\n                  A total of 0.2 g leaves were ground in 4 ml extracting solution (3 ml 50 mM PH7.8 PBS and 1 ml 1 mM EDTA·2Na) and the homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected for enzyme activity analysis. The activities of SOD, POD and APX were measured by spectrophotometry according to the method described by Giannopolitis et al. [36], Zheng et al. [37] and Hossain et al. [38], respectively.\n                Na+, K+ and Ca2+ contents\n                The leaves and roots of transgenic plants and wildtype treated with or without 200 mM NaCl were used for the Na+, K+ and Ca2+ content measurement according to Shukla et al. [39].\n              Statistical analysis\n                Data in this study were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA, and the means were compared by Duncan test at a significance level of 0.05 by using SPSS (version 12, SPSSInc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were shown as mean ± SE.

However, a paucity of genomic information and DNA markers has restricted the development of modern breeding technologies for almond trees.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, almonds were sequenced with Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to obtain transcriptome data and develop simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. We generated approximately 64 million clean reads from the various tissues of mixed almonds, and a total of 42,135 unigenes with an average length of 988 bp were obtained in the present study. A total of 27,586 unigenes (57.7% of all unigenes generated) were annotated using several databases. A total of 112,812 unigenes were annotated with the Gene Ontology (GO) database and assigned to 82 functional sub-groups, and 29,075 unigenes were assigned to the KOG database and classified into 25 function classifications. There were 9470 unigenes assigned to 129 Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways from five categories in the KEGG pathway database. We further identified 8641 SSR markers from 48,012 unigenes. A total of 100 SSR markers were randomly selected to validate quality, and 82 markers could amplify the specific products of A. communis L., whereas 70 markers were successfully transferable to five species (A. ledebouriana, A. mongolica, A. pedunculata, A. tangutica, and A. triloba).\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our study was the first to produce public transcriptome data from almonds. The development of SSR markers will promote genetics research and breeding programmes for almonds.\n              Keywords\n                        Prunus amygdalus BatschTranscriptomeFunctional classificationSSR markersBackgroundThe almond (Prunus amygdalus Batsch) is one of the world’s most important nut crops. The almond belongs to the genus Prunus, subgenus Amygdalus [1]. Almonds are widely used in food production and have high nutritional value [2]. Most Amygdalus wild species are highly tolerant of cold, drought and salt [3]. Almonds are a typical outbreeding species with gametophyte self-incompatibility [4]. They are also an antioxidant source [5] and an important germplasm resource in breeding programmes [6]. Because almonds have high nutritional value, past research has largely focused on physicochemical properties, seed nutrients and oil extraction [2, 7, 8]. However, despite high economic and nutritional values, genome and genetic resources regarding almonds are scarce, which has restricted the development of modern breeding technologies for almonds.Molecular markers are important tools used in evaluating genetic diversity among plant species and plant molecular breeding (marker-assisted breeding). In almond trees, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been developed, but currently, there are only 3926 ESTs and gene loci available for almond in the NCBI GenBank database. Therefore, the number of ESTs is not sufficient to address almond tree molecular breeding development. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are widely used in studies on genetic diversity and relationships of plants because they are highly polymorphic, co-dominant and reproducible [9]. Moreover, SSRs markers could be used in the QTL mapping of important agronomical traits loci and marker-assisted selection in almond trees [10–13]. Presently, however, only a few SSRs have been reported in almonds [14–16]. SRAP and AFLP markers have been used to study genetic diversity and relationships in wild Amygdalus species [2]. A transcriptome is the complete collection of RNA that includes the full range of mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, and other noncoding RNA molecules expressed by one or a group of cells, organs or tissues in a particular environment or a specific developmental stage. The Illumina paired-end sequencing technique has been widely used for transcriptome analysis in plants [10, 17–19].Transcriptome sequencing is helpful in developing SSR molecular markers, as it is reliable and efficient [20]. However, transcriptomic and associated molecular markers in almonds have not yet been reported. In this study, Illumina sequencing technology was used to analyse the transcriptome of almonds and develop EST-SSR markers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize the almond transcriptome. Our study will provide a foundation for almond molecular biology and molecular breeding of almonds.ResultsTranscriptome generation and de novo assembly\n                A total of 66,668,192 raw reads were generated from our Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 paired-end sequencing of almonds. The total length of the reads was approximately 10 Gigabase pairs (Gb); a total of 64,924,070 (97.38%) high-quality clean reads (1,440,780, 4.32%) as well as low-quality reads (1,702,602, 2.55%) were collected after removing the adapter. All high-quality reads were assembled using the Trinity program, and a total of 42,135 unigenes with an average length of 988 bp and an N50 length of 1714 bp were obtained. The unigenes ranged from 201 bp to 15,555 bp (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1, 27,723 unigenes (65.80%) ranged from 201 to 1000 bp, 8699 unigenes (20.65%) were longer than 1000 bp and 5713 unigenes (13.56%) were longer than 2000 bp. The coverage percentage of read-blasted unigenes was 55.74% (more than 10 reads), 19.17% (more than 100 reads), and 25.09% (more than 1000 reads) (Additional file 1). All of the raw data were submitted to the NCBI database (accession number: PRJNA347906).Table 1\n                        Summary of transcriptome data for persimmon\n                      ItemNumber1.

A total of 27,586 unigenes (57.7% of all unigenes) were annotated. A total of 29,315 unigenes (69.6% of all unigenes) of the largest match were annotated in the Nr database, followed by the Swiss-Prot (20,642, 49.0%), KOG (16,794, 39.9%) and KEGG (11,055, 26.2%) databases (Fig. 2). A total of 12,671 (42.5%) unigenes were not annotated in the four databases, indicating that these unigenes may be novel genes (Table 1). For the annotated unigenes in the Nr databases, the homologous sequences belonging to the species were analysed. The ten top-hit species were Prunus mume (18,097, 61.73%), Malus domestica (15,80, 5.40%), Theobroma cacao (1238, 4.22%), Pyrus x bretschneideri (1132, 3.86%), Prunus persica (1061, 3.46%), Gossypium arboreum (853, 2.90%), Brassica napus (710, 2.42%), Medicago truncatula (682, 2.33%), Fragaria vesca subsp. vesca (665, 2.27%), Morus notabilis (311, 1.06%), and others (3029, 10.34%).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Venn diagram of Nr, Swiss-Prot, KOG and KEGG databases.

A total of 112,812 unigenes were assigned to 82 functional sub-groups. Of the three ontology categories, the largest was biological process (51,202 unigenes), followed by cellular component (37,133 unigenes) and molecular function (24,483 unigenes) (Fig. 3). For the biological process group, the most frequent process was metabolic process (11,647, 22.75%), followed by cellular process (10,967, 21.42%). Cell (8581, 23.11%) and cell part (8581, 23.11%) were the most highly represented groups in the cellular component category. For the molecular function category, binding (11,139, 45.50%) and catalytic activity (10,346, 27.86%) represented the greatest proportion. The GO classifications of the unigenes are listed in Additional file 2.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        GO function classification of the almond transcriptome.

A total of 29,075 unigenes were classified into 25 function classifications (Fig. 4). For the 25 KOG categories, the general function prediction was the largest group (5895, 20.28%); posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (3311, 11.39%), and signal transduction mechanisms (3152, 10.84%) had high percentages, and 15,012 unigenes were assigned to other functional categories (Additional file 3).\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        KOG function classification of the almond transcriptome. A total of 25 categories were obtained. The x-axis indicates the categories, and the y-axis indicates the numbers of the unigenes\n                      \n              Functional classifications by KEGG\n                The pathway annotations were used to analyse the biological functions of genes. In this study, 9470 unigenes were assigned to 129 KEGG pathways that belonged to five categories, namely, metabolic pathways (5648, 59.60%), genetic information processing (2636, 27.8%), cellular processes (512, 5.4%), environmental information processing (389, 4.1%) and organismal systems (285, 3.0%) (Additional file 4). The majority of the unigene pathways were associated with ribosomes (443, 7.3%), carbon metabolism (320, 5.3%), protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (290, 4.8%), biosynthesis of amino acids (277, 4.9%), spliceosomes (274, 4.5%), plant hormone signal transduction (249, 4.1%) and endocytosis (245, 4.0%).\n              Development and characterisation of SSR markers\n                In this study, the unigene sequences were used to develop new SSR markers with MISA software. A total of 8641 SSRs were identified from 48,012 unigenes. For the 8641 SSRs, di-nucleotide motifs were the most abundant form (5141, 59.5%), followed by tri-nucleotides (2416, 28.5%), tetra-nucleotides (606, 7.0%), hexa-nucleotides (277, 3.2%) and penta-nucleotides (201, 2.3%) (Table 2). In addition, the number of repeated units of the di-nucleotide motifs ranged from 6 to 15, and the tri-nucleotide, tetra-nucleotide, penta-nucleotide, and hexa-nucleotide motifs included 5 to 15, 4 to 10, 4 to 8, and 4 to 7, respectively. SSRs with six tandem repeats were the most frequent (1795, 20.8%), followed by five tandem repeats (1543, 17.9%), more than fifteen tandem repeats (1228, 14.2%), seven tandem repeats (1095, 12.7%), and others (Table 3). The most frequent motif types of SSRs were AG/CT (49.0%), followed by AAG/CTT (9.3%), AT/AT (5.9%), AC/GT (4.5%), AGG/CCT (3.6%) and others (Additional file 5).Table 2\n                        Summary of the EST-SSRr data for almond\n                      ItemNumberTotal number of sequences examined42,135Total size of examined sequences (bp)41,663,061Total number of identified SSRs8641Number of SSR containing sequences6780Number of sequences containing more than 1 SSR1433Number of SSRs present in compound formation752Di-nucleotide5141 (59.5%)Tri-nucleotide2416 (28.5%)Tetra-nucleotide606 (7.0%)Penta-nucleotide201 (2.3%)Hexa-nucleotide277 (3.2%)Table 3\n                        Summary of the different repeat units of identified EST-SSRs\n                      Number of repeat unitDi-Tri-Tetra-Penta-HexaTotalPercentage (%)4004351512007869.15013211213962154317.9611565923179179520.877713021336109512.78596674106687.79566381006057.010439581004985.811237110002482.912389000470.513510000150.21410940001131.3=<U+2009>1512244000122814.2Total514124166062012778641100\n              Cross-species transferability of A. communis SSR markers\n                One hundred SSR sites were randomly selected to design SSR primers (Additional file 6). Among these 100 primer pairs, 82 could amplify the specific products (these 82 markers are highlighted in red in Additional file 6), while the remaining 18 did not generate PCR products. To validate the transferability of A. communis SSR markers, five species (A. ledebouriana, A. mongolica, A. pedunculata, A. tangutica, and A. triloba) (Additional file 7) were assessed using the 82 SSR markers selected above. The results indicated that 70 SSR markers were transferable to these five species and that 12 SSR markers did not generate bands. The PCR amplification results of some primers are shown in Fig. 5. The UPMGA cluster analysis indicated that A. communis and A. mongolica are more closely related (Fig. 6).\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Examples of polymorphic products amplified by different SSR primer pairs. 1–25 represent different primer pairs.

Previous studies concerning almonds focused on physicochemical properties, seed nutrients and oil extraction [2, 7, 8]. However, no studies have yet constructed a genetic linkage map, including QTL mapping of important agronomical traits and marker-assisted selection in almond trees. Until now, genome sequencing of some important fruits has been completed using NGS technologies. Transcriptome analysis based on NGS technologies, such as Illumina and 454 sequencing platforms, has provided an efficient tool for obtaining genomic data for some plants without a reference genome, such as wax gourds [21] and pumpkins [22]. Therefore, we sequenced the almond transcriptome to obtain genomic data and then developed many SSR markers. These transcriptome data will provide information for future studies on breeding and molecular biology.In this study, a large number of transcriptomic unigenes (42135) was obtained using the Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 platform, and the average unigene length was 988 bp. Consistent with recently published plant species, the average length of the unigenes was relatively long (835 bp) compared to black gram (443 bp) [10], caragana (709 bp) [18], wax gourd (709 bp) [21], pumpkin (765 bp) [22], Siberian apricot (652 bp) [23], Chinese jujube (473.4 bp) [24], and safflower (446 bp) [25]. These results indicate a higher quality of almond transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly. In this study, approximately 27,586 unigenes (57.7% of all unigenes) were annotated by BLAST searches of the Nr, GO, Swiss-Prot, KEGG and KOG databases. Moreover, 12,671 (42.5%) of the unigenes did not annotate to any databases. Technical limitations, such as read length and sequencing depth, may account for these unannotated unigenes. For gene annotation, the sequences of unigenes were blasted against the Nr, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, GO and KOG databases. Approximately 27,586 unigenes (57.7% of all unigenes) were annotated in four protein databases, indicating that the transcriptomic data of almonds may have large transcript diversity. Additionally, approximately 12,671 (42.5%) unigenes were not annotated to the four databases, suggesting that some unigenes may be unique to almonds.SSR markers have been important in some research, including the assessment of genetic diversity and genetic relationships, the construction of genetic maps, marker-assisted selection of important agronomic traits, and others [2, 26]. Previous studies have also shown that SSR markers are highly polymorphic, codominant and easily reproducible [9]. Due to the time-consuming and expensive nature of traditional methods for SSR marker development, few SSR markers have been reported for almonds, and no studies have reported the development of SSR markers in A. communis, which has limited the application of SSR markers in almond trees. Transcriptome sequencing is an efficient technology for the development of SSR markers in plants, and the SSR markers for some plants have been reported using transcriptome sequencing [10, 21–25]. Our results produced a large number of transcriptome sequences that could be used to develop SSR markers in almonds. In total, 8641 SSR markers were identified from 48,012 unigenes. In this study, di-nucleotide motifs were the most abundant form, followed by tri-nucleotides, tetra-nucleotides, hexa-nucleotides and penta-nucleotides, which is similar to previous studies [23–25]. In addition, the most abundant di-nucleotides and tri-nucleotides were AG/CT and AAG/CTT, respectively, which was consistent with previous reports [20–24]. To assess the quality of SSR markers, we randomly selected 100 pairs of primers and assessed them in five species. Eighty-two percent showed polymorphisms. This result was similar to results found in other plants. The UPMGA cluster analysis indicated that A. communis and A. mongolica were more closely related, which was consistent with Jing et al., who reported using SRAP markers [2]. We believe that the new SSR markers will be used to study genetic diversity, genetic mapping, and, in particular, marker-assisted breeding for almonds.ConclusionThis paper reports on the transcriptome characterizations of almond trees and provides a large number of SSR markers to elucidate the molecular biology of almond trees. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop SSR markers for almonds using a transcriptome sequencing method, and these developed SSR markers will significantly contribute to genetic diversity studies, QTL mapping, and marker-assisted selection breeding for almonds. Notably, due to high transferability, these SSR markers may provide an efficient tool to accelerate molecular breeding in other Amygdalus species.MethodsPlant materials and RNA extraction\n                Plants of A. communis were grown at the experimental farm of Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China. Tissues from leaves, flowers, stems and fruits were harvested from six individuals. The sampled tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for later RNA extraction. The RNA samples were isolated using an E.Z.N.A.® Plant RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and quantity of RNA were assessed using electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA), respectively. High-quality RNA was used for further analyses. Equal amounts of RNA from different samples were pooled for further studies.\n              cDNA library construction and transcriptome sequencing\n                After the RNA was extracted, the cDNA library construction was performed using a TransCript® cDNA sample prep kit (TransGen Biotech, China). The ligation products were size-selected with agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR-amplified, and sequenced using Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China).\n              Data filtering, de novo assembly and function annotation\n                Reads obtained from the sequencing machines included raw reads containing adapters or low-quality bases that would affect the following assembly and analysis. Thus, to obtain high-quality clean reads, the clean reads were assembled using the Trinity assembly program [27]. The isoform was obtained using Trinity software. To eliminate redundant information, the longest isoform was taken as the gene to further analyse; this was defined as the unigene. The functional annotation of unigene sequences was performed by BLASTX search of the non-redundant (Nr) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) database, Swiss-Prot protein database, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG) database, and Gene Ontology (GO) database with an E-value <<U+2009>10–5. We used the Blast2GO program to analyse the GO annotations of the unigenes [28]. The functional classifications were determined with WEGO software [29]. Pathway information of unigenes was collected from KEGG databases [30].\n              SSR detection and primer design\n                MISA software (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/misa.html) was used to identify microsatellites in the whole transcriptome. The parameters were as follows: definition (unit_size, min_repeats): 2–6 3–5 4–4 5–4 6–4; interruptions (max_difference_between_2_SSRs): 100. If the distance between two SSRs was shorter than 100 bp, they were considered to be one SSR. Based on the MISA results, primer pairs of each SSR loci were designed using Primer premier 3.0 (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA) in the flanking regions of SSRs.\n              Validation of SSR markers\n                To validate the SSR markers, a total of 100 primer pairs were randomly selected and synthesized. Wild almond germplasm from six species (A. communis, A. ledebouriana, A. mongolica, A. pedunculata, A. tangutica, and A. triloba) were used to validate the SSR markers. The total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaves using a plant DNA extraction kit (TIANGEN®, China). The DNA quality and concentration were tested with a NanoDrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). PCR amplification reactions were performed in a 25 µL volume, containing 40 ng of DNA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.5 pM aliquots of forward and reverse primers, 2.5 mM Mg2+, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Biotechnology Dalian Co., Ltd., China), and 1× Taq Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl). PCR amplification was performed with the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, a primer-specific annealing temperature for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s; and 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using silver staining. The molecular size of the amplified fragments was estimated using a 10-bp DNA ladder (TransGen Biotech, China).\n              Abbreviations\n                GO: \n                    Gene Ontology\n                  KEGG: \n                    Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes\n                  KOG: \n                    Clusters of Orthologous Groups\n                  Nr: \n                    non-redundant\n                  SSR: \n                    simple sequence repeats marker\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe would like to thank AJE (https://www.aje.com/) for their expert language editing of this manuscript.\n                Funding\n                This work was supported by the earmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System (CARS-28), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015 M582712), the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (2016BSHYDZZ07), and the Science and Technology Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province (2015KTZDNY02-03-01, 2015KJZDNY02-03-02, 2016KJXX-58).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                The data are available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/.\n              Authors’ contributionsL-SZ and Z-BJ conceived the project and designed the experiments.

In this study, we used Illumina sequencing to determine the global gene expression profiles in horses with white-colored coats and those with black-colored coats, with the goal of identifying novel genes that could regulate horse coat color.\n              \n                Results\n                Genes encoding ribosomal-associated proteins were highly expressed in horse skin. We found a total of 231 unigenes that were differentially expressed between horses with white coats and horses with black coats; 119 were down-regulated, and 112 were up-regulated. Many of the up-regulated genes in black horses, such as genes related to tyrosine metabolism, may directly regulate dark coat color. Keratin genes, MIA family genes, fatty acid-related genes, and melanoma-associated genes were also differentially regulated, which suggests that they may play important roles in coat color formation.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                These findings show that the transcription profiles from white and black horse skin provide useful information to understand the genetics underlying the control of skin melanin synthesis in horses, which may enhance our knowledge of human skin diseases, such as melanoma and albinism.\n              KeywordsMongolian horseRNA-SeqCoat colorPigmentationTyrosineBackgroundMammalian coat colors are determined by the quantities and distributions of melanin, which are dependent on the interaction between the genotype and the environment [1]. The most important pigments, including melanin and its derivatives, are synthesized in melanocytes by oxidation of tyrosine or tyrosine-related materials.Mutation analyses have identified various genes that are involved in determining coat color in the horse [2]. Many of these genes regulate the expression and distribution of melanin, and their mutation can cause different phenotypes of the coat, skin, and eyes. Many of these gene mutations are situated within more than 60 loci that affect phenotype, and most are highly conserved in mammals, though the extent of their effect on pigment deposition varies [3]. Genes that commonly regulate skin and coat color in different mammalian species can be separated into 2 categories: one regulates the production, proliferation, or migration of different types of melanocytes, and the other affects pigment synthesis directly. Therefore, the formation of different skin and coat colors is determined by the regulation of genes that can change the progression/differentiation of melanocytes or the process of melanin synthesis [2].At the cellular level, melanocytes put pigment granules into hair and skin cells; the presence and function of melanocytes therefore determine the amount, type, and character of pigmentation. Melanocytes originate along the neural crest, which also gives rise to the spinal cord and brain, and then migrate to the skin during embryogenesis [4]. The importance of this is that the pigmentary and nervous systems are closely allied in the embryo, and certain genes affect both.Melanocytes can produce either pheomelanin or eumelanin as determined by a receptor on their surface, MC1R [5]. This receptor is activated by melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which is secreted by the pituitary gland. When activation occurs, the cells form eumelanin, while in the absence of activation, the cells form pheomelanin [6]. Whether the receptor becomes activated is determined by 2 factors: the presence or absence of melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the presence or absence of cell surface receptors. Because melanocyte-stimulating hormone is consistently available to most cells in horses, regulation at the level of surface receptors is more important.Previous studies to identify genes involved in skin pigmentation have focused on genetic polymorphisms. In the present study, we generated transcriptome profiles for horses with black or white skin utilizing high-throughput RNA deep-sequencing technology. Black and white skin from Mongolian horses was collected, and differentially expressed genes were identified by RNA-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing platform that allows for the detection and quantification of transcripts at low abundance, including novel transcript units [7]. The identification of genes for melanin production, distribution, and formation can provide a theoretical basis for the selection of skin traits during the selective breeding of horses. Additionally, increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in skin pigmentation may have significance for other animals, including humans, in terms of skin-related diseases such as melanoma and albinism.MethodsAnimal selection\n                This investigation involved 2 Mongolian horses with black coat color (black1, black2) and 2 Mongolian horses with white coat color (white1, white2). All guidelines of the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee and the Animal Care Guidelines of the Inner Mongolia Agricultural University were followed when conducting experiments on the Mongolian horses.\n              Feeding and management of animals\n                The black and white Mongolian horses were raised under equivalent conditions. All animals had free access to the same natural pasture. The animals were provided the same feeding regime for 6 months prior to skin collection.\n              Sampling and excision biopsy\n                Skin biopsies were taken from the 4 Mongolian horses to analyze the enzymatic activity and metabolic status of melanocytes in the skin. The samples were collected in an exam room at the Inner Mongolia Agricultural University according to internal protocols and procedures. To achieve both sedation and analgesia, each animal received an intravenous bolus of 0.4 ml of detomidine hydrochloride per 100 kg of body weight. The inside of the hind legs underwent a wide cleaning and disinfection. After shaving to remove the hair, an excisional biopsy was carried out, and a small area of =1 cm2 was removed and stored in a tube with a sample protector for tissues. The wound was then immediately sutured with re-absorbent closures.\n              RNA extraction\n                Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and its purity and integrity were assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, genomic DNA was removed by treating the RNA sample with RNase-free DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C.\n              cDNA library construction and Illumina sequencing\n                To obtain poly (A) mRNA from the total RNA, oligo (dT) magnetic beads were used (Illumina). The RNA was broken down into short fragments by the addition of fragmentation buffer. These short fragments were then used as templates for first-strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase (Illumina). To synthesize the second strand of the cDNA, a solution of RNase H (Illumina), DNA polymerase I (Illumina), dNTPs, and buffer was used. The ends of the resulting double-stranded cDNA fragments were repaired, and adapters were ligated. The final version of the cDNA library was prepared from these products by purification and subsequent amplification by PCR. Using the Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform, the four prepared cDNA libraries were sequenced, resulting in 100-bp paired-end reads.\n              Sequence preprocessing and functional annotation\n                The raw sequence data was processed using a Perl script developed in our lab; it removed the adapter sequences and filtered the low-quality reads and genes with N = 10%. The resultant clean sequence data were mapped to the horse genome (Equus caballus) using TopHat2 without the discordant or mixed options. The reads that were uniquely mapped to the horse genome were analyzed to determine the approximate gene abundance, and gene expression levels were calculated by the reads per kilobase per million mapped (FPKM). Additionally, differentially expressed genes between the 2 Mongolian horses with black coat color and 2 Mongolian horses with white coat color were estimated by edgR using FPKM based on multiple significance tests. If |log2 (fold change)| > 1.4 and FDR < 0.05, then these genes were considered as differently expressed.\n              Enrichment analysis\n                The functional annotation and pathway enrichment of genes that were differentially expressed between black- and white-skinned horses were performed using the online analysis tool DAVID (DAVID 6.7: https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp), which is a program that manages the enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that characterize genes. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mapped to the GO database, and the hypergeometric test was utilized to determine which GO terms were significantly enriched among the DEGs against the background of the horse genome; GO terms were considered to be significantly enriched in the DEGs when they had corrected p-values <0.05. To determine which KEGG pathways, and therefore which complex biological behaviors, were enriched in the DEG data, a similar method was used (threshold: corrected p-value <0.05).\n              Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation\n                Immediately after its removal, a piece of skin (approximately 0.5 cm2) was frozen in liquid nitrogen until needed for later qRT-PCR analysis. Its total RNA was obtained using Trizol (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After its extraction, the total RNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water. Approximately 0.5 µg of total RNA was used as a template for first-strand cDNA preparation using the PrimerScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The synthesized cDNA was diluted to 0.1 µg/µl for analysis by qRT-PCR (Bio-Rad) using the SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa). The housekeeping gene GAPDH was selected as the control. To determine the relative levels of gene expression, the 2-<U+0394>Ct (<U+0394>Ct = Cttarget gene - CtGAPDH) method was used. ANOVA (using SAS software 9.0) was used to determine which genes were differentially expressed between black- and white-colored horse skins.\n              ResultsAssembly and functional classification of unigenes from horse skin\n                A total of 24,301,563, 22,691,201, 19,423,074 and 20,465,943 pair-end reads were generated in the black1, black2, white1 and white2 libraries, respectively, after the raw reads were filtered from the skins of white and black horses. Of the 231 known genes, 202 were marked using GO analysis. This collection of genes was sorted into 63 classes using their putative functions as a basis for categorization. The largest collection of genes was sorted entirely by general function. Additionally, we annotated the known genes utilizing GO classification analysis and sorted them into 3 groups (74.6% were “biological processes,” 11.1% were “cellular components,” and 14.3% were “molecular function”) based on their presumed functions (Fig. 1).\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        GO functional analysis of DEGs based on RNA-Seq data.

Twenty-five of the 30 most highly expressed genes encoded ribosomal proteins; Equus caballus eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (EEF1A1) and three unknown genes were also highly expressed in the horse skin.Table 1\n                        The 30 genes highly expressed in horse skin\n                      GeneBlack coat color FPKMWhite coat color FPKMLATH72,81120,843LOC10005360127,9817759RPL3722,69215,081EEF1A115,28016,186RPS1211,68910,908RPS2710,7929377RPL23A10,6748141RPL3110,4039728RPL1010,0211180RPL3097857974RPL3585717940RPS2683207405RPS3A81908098RPL13A81387984RPS1981027883RPL36A78151615RPS2577646562LOC10014671175006102LOC10063041074235754RPLP072817544RPS2072477066RPS1171176546RPL2671027405RPS769836742RPS2368695602RPS1868655851RPL35A67615431RPL1766996305RPL3966066870RPL963725806\n              GO enrichment analysis of in genes that are differentially expressed in black- and white-colored skins\n                We assessed the 202 unigenes that were differentially expressed in black and white coat color horses by GO enrichment analysis. Among 97 known genes that were classified as “biological processes,” 15 genes were related to tyrosine metabolism; additionally, there were 58 known genes related to skin development. Among the 54 unigenes that were classified as “cellular components,” 17 genes were related to the endoplasmic reticulum; and among 41 known “molecular function” genes, 13 genes were related to acyltransferase activity and carboxylesterase activity (Table 2).Table 2\n                        GO ontology of differentially expressed genes of black and white horse skin\n                      GO ontologyCluster frequency\n                                            P valueDEG%Biological processes Lipid metabolic process211.412.60E-05 Lipid biosynthetic process130.872.70E-05 Cellular lipid metabolic process161.075.74E-05 Skeletal system development120.801.15E-04 Behavior130.878.62E-04 Phospholipid biosynthetic process60.402.04E-03 Tyrosine metabolic process30.202.65E-03 System development342.282.84E-03 Gycerolipid metabolic process70.473.05E-03 developmental process422.813.71E-03 Multicellular organismal development392.614.03E-03 Secondary metabolic process50.335.13E-03 Glycerolipid biosynthetic process50.335.37E-03 Anatomical structure development352.345.56E-03 Phospholipid metabolic process70.476.62E-03 Multicellular organismal process523.486.63 E-03 Response to wounding120.806.97E-03 Organ development261.748.40E-03 Organophosphate metabolic process70.478.42E-03 Carboxylic acid transport60.409.57E-03 Organic acid transport60.409.84E-03 Aromatic amino acid family metabolic process30.200.0119 Aromatic compound catabolic process30.200.0131 Regulation of biological quality221.470.0169 Cell adhesion130.870.0201 Amine transport50.330.0202 Biological adhesion130.870.0203 Oxoacid metabolic process110.740.0246 Carboxylic acid metabolic process110.740.0246 Organic acid metabolic process110.740.0257 Cellular ketone metabolic process110.740.0276 Vitamin metabolic process40.270.0282 Response to external stimulus151.000.0300 Tissue development120.800.0321 Locomotory behavior70.470.0339 Metal ion homeostasis60.400.0346 Anterior/posterior pattern formation50.330.0349 Chemical homeostasis100.670.0365 System process211.410.0384 Lipid transport50.330.0389 Cation homeostasis70.470.0404 Sensory perception of light stimulus60.400.0418 Visual perception60.400.0418 Tyrosine catabolic process20.130.0431 Regulation of very-low-density lipoprotein particle remodeling20.130.0431 Amino acid transport40.270.0448 Lipid localization50.330.0496Cellular component Extracellular region392.618.82E-07 Extracellular region part231.541.63E-05 Extracellular space171.142.10E-04 Endoplasmic reticulum171.146.86E-03 High-density lipoprotein particle30.200.0186 Protein-lipid complex30.200.0350 Plasma lipoprotein particle30.200.0350Molecular function O-acyltransferase activity70.477.67E-07 Acyltransferase activity90.602.76E-04 Transferase activity, transferring acyl groups other than amino-acyl groups90.602.95E-04 Transferase activity, transferring acyl groups90.603.83E-04 Receptor binding171.142.77 E-03 Cytokine activity70.475.80E-03 Hemoglobin binding20.130.0248 Protein dimerization activity100.670.0371 Carboxylesterase activity40.270.0460\n                      % = DGE/BGDGE × 100%; DEG represents the number of differentially expressed genes annotated to each GO ontology.

For these 18 genes, the mRNA expression levels determined by qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq were significantly correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.825, p < 0.05), confirming that our RNA-Seq data was highly reproducible (Fig. 3).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        qRT-PCR validation of DEGs characterized by RNA-Seq. The results verify the differential expression of genes in black and white coat color skin, which is consistent with the RNA-Seq findings\n                      \n              DiscussionThe mechanisms of melanogenesis are intricate, and recent publications have furthered our understanding of melanin production in the skin [8, 9]. The interactions of several basic factors, most of which are from single genetic loci, are responsible for the various colors of most horses. With the development of advanced sequencing technology, skin and coat color genetics have been well studied [10]; however, most studies have focused on gene polymorphisms, whereas the impact of gene expression on coat color has not been well characterized.The GO and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that the vast majority of the DEGs were related to “biological processes”. The pathways related to tyrosine metabolic and catabolic processes were of particular interest in our dataset. Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid responsible for melanin production via its oxidation and polymerization [11].To confirm the Illumina results, we performed qRT-PCR for specific genes. The DCT, HPD, and TAT genes were verified to be differentially expressed in white and black horses. These genes each participate in tyrosine metabolism. Dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) catalyzes the rearrangement of dopachrome to the carboxylated derivative DHICA [12]. The results of DCT on UV DNA damage and survival pathways in human melanocytic cells were determined by knockdown tests in melanoma cells, neonatal foreskin melanoblasts in monoculture, and co-cultures with human keratinocytes [13, 14]. DCT plays a major role in the coat color of cattle [15, 16] and rhesus macaques [17]. At the DCT locus, 3 mutations are known that affect pigmentation phenotypes. Guyonneau (2004) generated a knockout of the Dct gene in mice with effects restricted to pigment production and coat color [18]. As shown in Fig. 4, DCT is involved in regulating eumelanin and pheomelanin levels [19].\n                    \n                  Fig. 4\n                      Common pathways of melanin synthesis in animals. Enzymes are abbreviated as follows: tyrosine aminotransferase, TA; tyrosine hydroxylase, TH; phenoloxidase, PO; dopachrome tautomerase, DCT; tyrosinase-related protein 1, TRP1; 5,6-dihydroxyindole, DHI; 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid, DHICA\n                    The Fe(II)-containing non-heme oxygenase 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) catalyzes the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate into homogentisate in the catabolism of tyrosine. HPD is linked to 1 of the oldest known inherited metabolic disorders, alkaptonuria, which is caused by low levels of homogentisate in the bloodstream. HPD is also directly linked to type III tyrosinemia [20]. When its concentration is low in the human body, high levels of tyrosine occur in the blood, which can cause mild mental retardation at birth and subsequent degradation in vision [21]. The liver enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) catalyzes the transformation of tyrosine into 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate [22]. It is the rate-limiting enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway that also includes HPD [23]. Because the accumulation of tyrosine in blood causes toxic effects to tissues and organs [24], the breakdown of tyrosine by TAT is very significant for human health. Type II tyrosinemia is caused by a deficiency in TAT [25]. Thus, each of these differentially regulated genes has functions in important processes affected by tyrosine metabolism. These 3 genes were up-regulated in the tyrosine metabolism pathway in horses of black coat color, indicating that the DCT, HPD, and TAT genes affect the formation of dark coat color.In our study, 4 keratin genes were indicated to be differentially expressed in black/white horse skin: keratin 35 was up-regulated in white coat color skin, and keratin 34, keratin 26, and keratin 39 were up-regulated in black coat color skin. Keratinocytes generate a large number of paracrine factors that affect the growth of pigment cells and their proliferation and behavior; changes in the expression of these factors affect melanocytosis via receptor-mediated signaling pathways [26]. This result suggests that the keratin family also affects dark coat color formation.We also identified 2 differentially expressed genes from the melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) family: MIA and otoraplin (OTOR). MIA has been shown to have growth-inhibitory activity on malignant melanoma cells in vitro [27, 28]. MIA is expressed and secreted by melanoma cells, but not melanocytes, and its mRNA levels parallel progressive malignancy of melanocytic tumors [29, 30]. In fact, increased MIA serum levels are considered to be a reliable tumor marker in detecting and monitoring metastatic disease and responses to therapy [31, 32]. OTOR is secreted via the Golgi apparatus and may function in cartilage development and maintenance. A frequent polymorphism in the translation start codon of this gene, potentially associated with alternative polyA sites, is associated with forms of deafness [33]. Gray horses are at an increased risk for melanoma, with 70–80% over the age of 15 presenting with melanomas [34]. It is possible that melanoma in light coat color horses is associated with the expression of MIA family genes.Other genes identified as differentially expressed in our study include PTN, RGS13, and SPARC. The secreted heparin-binding protein pleiotrophin (PTN) has been shown to be involved in cell growth and differentiation [35]. Not much is known about the effects of PTN on skin pigmentation and melanocyte function. Transfection studies, however, have shown that PTN decreases melanogenesis through MITF degradation via Erk1/2 activation [36]. In vitro, the chemotaxis of B cells is controlled by the regulator of G-protein signaling 13 (RGS13); this control is thought to be carried out by increasing the GTPase activity of Ga proteins that are coupled to chemokine receptors [37]. RGS13 expression also reduces cAMP production [38], which plays an important role in melanoma even though genetic alterations in components of this pathway are not commonly found in melanomas [39, 40]. The incorporation of collagen into the skin is controlled by secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) (or osteonectin or BM-40) [41]. SPARC has various roles that it carries out in cooperation with many extracellular matrix units: it behaves as a de-adhesive molecule, regulates cytokine and growth factor activities, and inhibits the cell cycle [42]. SPARC has also been shown to be strongly expressed in advanced primary and metastatic melanomas [43]. Although the molecular events responsible for their activity remain to be defined, the upregulation of PTN, RGS13, and SPARC in black color skin could explain the incidence of melanoma in light coat color horses.True white horses of the kind used in this study have the dominant-negative W allele of the KIT gene [44, 45]. KIT encodes stem cell factor (steel factor) that is involved in stem cell differentiation and subsequent melanocytic migration [46]. Failure of melanocyte migration results in white markings on horses, including all-white coats. We did not find any differences in gene expression of KIT in the present study, though this could be due to the small sample size. However, similar global gene expression profiling of black and white sheep skin using Illumina sequencing [47] and transcriptome profiling of black and white rabbits [48] also did not find differential expression of KIT. Similar to our results, these studies did find up-regulated genes related to tyrosine metabolism and melanogenesis, including DCT in sheep, as well as keratin family genes. Zhang and coworkers [49] cataloged global gene expression profiles in Lueyang chickens with white versus black skin by Illumina2000 sequencing, and found differential expression of KIT. They also discovered up-regulation of tyrosine metabolism genes in black skinned chickens, but not changes in the expression of keratin family members. Overall, these results and those of the present study indicate that while there are many common differences in gene expression between white and black skinned vertebrates, they also vary considerably by species. More work is needed to determine the specific factors involved and their mechanisms.ConclusionIn this study, differentially expressed genes in horses with white and black coat colors were screened using high-throughput sequencing. The genes identified in this study may affect the formation of horse coat color directly or indirectly. Although the genes controlling horse coat color formation are not completely known, the transcription analysis presented in this study provides valuable information. For the first time, we present a collection of genes that are differentially expressed in horse skins of different colors. Some genes have not been described previously, and others are known, but they are likely to be involved in skin pigmentation and other physiological functions. The description of these differentially expressed genes will allow further study of the molecular regulation of horse coat color.Declarations\n                Funding\n                This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31360538, 31472070), Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia (2015BS0314, 2017ZD06), Inner Mongolia key laboratory project (20130902) and Engineering Research Center of Horse Science and Industry of Inner Mongolia (201603002).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                We have provided detailed information about materials and method in our manuscript, so we will not provide data and supporting materials in this section.\n              Authors’ contributionsBL and XH conceived the research.

A plethora of steps are required to form, from a precursor, the mature miRNA that eventually acts on its target RNA to repress its expression or to inhibit translation. Recently, Drosophila nibbler (nbr) has been shown to be an important player in the maturation process of miRNA and piRNA. Nbr is an exoribonuclease which helps to shape the 3' end of miRNAs by trimming the 3' overhang to a final length.\n              \n                Results\n                In contrast to previous reports on the localization of Nbr, we report that 1) Nbr is expressed only during a short time of oogenesis and appears ubiquitously localized within oocytes, and that 2) Nbr was is not enriched in the nuage where it was shown to be involved in piwi-mediated mechanisms. To date, there is little information available on the function of nbr for cellular and developmental processes. Due to the fact that nbr mutants are viable with minor deleterious effects, we used the GAL4/UAS over-expression system to define novel functions of nbr. We disclose hitherto unknown functions of nbr 1) as a tumor suppressor and 2) as a suppressor of RNAi. Finally, we confirm that nbr is a suppressor of transposon activity.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our data suggest that nbr exerts much more widespread functions than previously reported from trimming 3' ends of miRNAs only.\n              Keywords\n                Drosophila\n              NibblerTumor formationNuageBackgroundIn eukaryotes, three main RNAi pathways have received considerable attention in the past: microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering (siRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) [18]. All three pathways reveal difference in their biogenesis, type of Argonaute family proteins, mode of target regulation and substrates [17]. The RNAi machinery and mechanisms associated with it are evolutionarily conserved in most eukaryotic organisms, including insects [42].During the last decade, microRNAs (miRNAs) were found to be important regulators of development, pathology and physiology of plant, as well as humans (reviewed by [22, 48]. Despite their small size of about 22 nucleotide (nt), these RNA molecules exert complex functions by binding preferentially to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target RNAs to block their function. miRNAs are initially synthesized by RNA polymerase II to yield a precursor miRNA of about 70 nt length which are 5' capped and which are also 3' polyadenylated which subsequently folds into a structure with a partially-paired stem, a single-stranded loop and a 2 nucleotide 3' overhang. These 3 features are characteristic for the primary miRNA.As a next step, these primary miRNA are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. There, Dicer, a RNase III processes the pre-miRNA to a 22 nt mature miRNA/miRNA* duplex [20, 27]. Subsequently, miRNA duplexes are assembled in a complex with Argonaute (Ago) to form the precursor RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [11]. This complex formation appears to be uncoupled from the synthesis of the miRNA. It is also within the RISC complex where one of the strands is chosen as the active silencing complex. Finally, the active miRNA within RISC binds preferentially to the 3' UTR of their target mRNAs which leads either to repression of the transcription or by inhibiting its translation [14].When measuring the length of the end of the 3' overhangs, it was noted that there was an unusually high heterogeneity within the per-miRNA molecules which was ascribed to a sloppy mode of action of RNase III. This necessitated to postulate the presence of yet another enzyme that would account for the precise outcome of the 2 nt overhang. In 2011, two groups presented Nibbler (Nbr) protein in Drosophila as a candidate enzyme belonging to the class of exoribonucleases which likely represented the missing link [23, 32]. in vitro assays showed that Nbr trims many miRNAs to a 22 nt product, when bound to Ago [23], exemplified on a preferred target, miR-34 [23, 32] which itself exists in several isoforms. In absence of nbr, all smaller isoforms of miR-34 are lost [32], indicating that Nbr has a specific function on trimming miR-34, but it would not exclude that nbr would have a broader set of targets. Interestingly, Nbr was predicted to contain no RNA-binding activity, therefore, it was suggested that Ago would exert this job, and only the binding of Nbr to Ago in an complex would allow to act on miRNAs. nbr flies were first reported to be semi-lethal and sterile [23, 32]. Later nbr flies were found to be viable, but showing accelerated age-related effects [15, 24, 49].Recently, research on the Piwi protein, a protein functionally and structurally close to Ago, and the associated piwi pathway furthered our understanding on the mechanisms of the biogenesis of small interference RNAs [24]. The piwi pathway and the associated piRNAs have mainly been studied in Drosophila. piRNAs are 23–29-nt small RNAs expressed predominantly in the oocyte [6, 34]. Concomitantly, piRNAs were discovered as master regulators to repress transposable elements (TEs) in Drosophila as well as in mice, rats, nematodes, and zebra fish [4, 19, 21, 31, 37, 39, 47]. It appears that there are thousands of distinct piRNA sequences present in the genomes of Drosophila [4]. To date, no structural or sequence similarity between the sequences of different piRNAs was found, except for a stronger bias for uracil in the first nucleotide [4]. In Drosophila, piRNAs recognize their targets, which predominantly are mRNAs of TEs through perfect or nearly perfect antisense matching. Hence, interfering with the piwi system may change the activity of transposon which may have deleterious effects on the organisms. piRNAs undergo several steps of maturation including formation of the primary piRNAs which are loaded onto Piwi [28]. As a further maturation process, the “Ping-Pong” cycle, reported to occur in the nuage of Drosophila germ cells [4], amplifies secondary piRNAs and thereby silences targets [12, 43]. Due to the amplification of the piRNAs, it is thought that the process consumes transcripts of TEs, thereby leading to a silencing of TEs. Conversely, interfering with the Ping-Pong cycle has likely the opposite effect, i. e. TE transcripts are present at unusually high levels. This in turn increases the probability of TEs to insert into developmentally-important genes or tumor-suppressor genes which may have deleterious effects such as generating cancer in tissues which otherwise would not happen if the regulation of TE activity was in balance.Given the importance of nbr, little information is available as to the overall function of nbr for development or cellular mechanisms in a broader context. We therefore thought to shed some light onto possible mechanisms. Instead of using classical mutants where information on the function is very limited, we used inducible nbr RNAi and dominant-negative versions of Nbr, and employed the GAL4/UAS over-expression system [3]. Using these approaches, we disclose hitherto novel functions of nbr in (i) regulating TE activity, and in (ii) suppressing tumors. Moreover, we show that Nrb is expressed very early during oogenesis and that nbr is involved in regulating small interfering RNA (siRNA) activity. Taken together, our data suggests that nbr reveals a broader involvement in regulative cellular processes than just trimming specific miRNAs.Methods\n                           Drosophila stocks\n                All transgenic stocks were obtained using conventional transformation techniques [36] and were maintained as balanced stocks. MS1096-GAL4, apterous-GAL4, tubulin-GAL4, paired-GAL4, en-GAL4 and UAS-nbr were obtained from the Bloomington stock center. UAS-Dg\n                           i\n                   flies were obtained from Martina Schneider [40].\n                The Drosophila Gene Collection clone GM01690 containing the complete ORF of nbr was used to generate the vectors pUAST-EGFP-nbr-D expressing the wild-type Nbr protein fused to EGFP, and pUAST-EGFP-nbr-N expressing the inactive Nbr protein fused to EGFP. Mutation of the catalytic domain was done by conventional inverse PCR using primers (5'-tcatatacctgAattctgaatggat-3') and (5'-atccattcagaatTcaggtatatga-3') to produce the amino acid substitution D435N (colored D in Fig. 1b). Both coding sequences were amplified with primers 5'-GGGCGGCCGCGAAATGGCACGCAAG-3' and 5'-CCTCTAGAGGCCAGTTCCTCAATC-3'. After restriction with Not I/Xba I, the amplified products were ligated in frame with EGFP, generating the vectors pUAST-EGFP-nbr-D and pUAST-EGFP-nbr-N. Sequencing of the constructs was performed before the establishment of transgenic lines.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Nbr harbors a exonuclease domain and is conserved from worms to humans. a schematic presentation of some 3'-5' exonuclease-containing proteins, drawn to scale.

Note that human FLJ20443 and Caenorhabditis elegans ZK1098.3 are likely nbr orthologues as they also contain a low-homology region (shaded oblique) common to all Nbr proteins. b Amino acid sequence alignment of the catalytic part of the 3'-5' exonuclease domain of the 6 proteins in Fig. 1a.

In order to compensate for the distinct abundance of transcripts, primers for copia were used at 200 nM and for rp49 at 40 nM.\n              In situ hybridization\n                Riboprobes were generated using a DIG-labeling kit (Roche). Two templates were amplified from cDNA and cloned into pBS (KS). The 5' template including the signal peptide sequence of nbr was amplified with primers (5'-ATGGTACCTCGCAATGAGTGATTTAC-3') and (5'-TATGGATCCTGCAGTTGGTTCTCTAGT-3') generating a 467 base pair probe. The 3' template from the cytoplasmic part of the gene was amplified with the primers, (5'-ACAAGTCGTCGTACAAGGA-3') and (5'-GACCACCATTCTTGTTTGTAGGCA-3') generating a 343 base pair probe. The procedure for in situ hybridization was carried out according to [46]. A sense probe was used as a negative control.\n              Generation of antibodies and immunohistochemistry\n                A NH2-terminal peptide CNFDATLDAKAEEFFKLFREKWNM comprising aa 46-69 of Nbr was used to immunize a rabbit. Crude serum from the 2nd bleed was used in all experiments. For Drosophila whole-mount staining, a Nbr monoclonal antibody [24] was used at 1:100 and detected using 2nd antibodies coupled to Alexa 555. For all immunofluorescence pictures, a Zeiss LSM 710 was used. For super-resolution recording, an Airy-Scan (Zeiss™) assembly was used in combination with a 63× lens. For Western analysis, embryos from the cross of the paired (prd)-GAL4 > UAS-nbr strain (Bloomington stock #16587) were used for 4-8 h extracts which, together with a 4-8 h wild-type extract of similar protein concentration were separated on a 10% PAGE and probed with the Nbr antiserum at a 1:2000 dilution.\n              RNA interference in cells\n                S2 cells were propagated in 1× Schneider’s Drosophila medium (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin at 27 °C. dsRNAs were produced from amplified DNA templates using a MEGASCRIPT T7 transcription kit (Ambion) following the protocol of [10]. DNA templates were amplified with primers containing a 5' T7 RNA polymerase binding site (5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCAC-3) followed by sequences specific for the targeted genes. The following primers were used: nbr (5'- TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACaggagtgcgtcatatacctg-3') and (5'- TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCACgcgttcaatgagcgtgttg-3'); GFP (5'- TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAgaccaccctgacctacggc-3') and (5'- TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGagaccacgaactccagcaggacc-3') and mock-lacZ (5'- TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3') and (5'- TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCAccgaactgagatacctacagc-3'), amplifying the 838 bp sequence of the vector pBluescript SK downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase binding site that includes the lacZ alpha gene. dsRNA products were DNase- treated, ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in DEPC water. The dsRNAs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that single bands of the expected size were present. S2 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche) in 3 cm dishes at 50%–70% confluence, following the manufacturer’s recommendation. The standard transfection reaction contained 2 µg of plasmid expressing GFP (pAC-EGFP), 2 µg of dsRNA targeting GFP and 2 µg of either nbr dsRNA or mock dsRNA.\n              Transgenic RNA interference construct\n                A 408 bp fragment at the 5' of the nbr gene (Fig. 1c) was amplified from cDNA with primers 5'-TGGTACCAGTGATCTCAGTGTATTGCAG-3' and 5'-CGGATCCTCAATCACTTAACATGGGCA -3'. After digestion with Kpn I/Bam HI, the fragment was subcloned both into pBluescript II (Stratagene) forming pKS-nbr and into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. Inversion of the sequence was achieved by excision of the Nhe I/Bam HI fragment of the pEGFP-N1 construct and subsequent ligation with a 148 bp Sau3A linker, derived from digestion of pEGFP-N1 with Sau3A, into pKS-nbr, cut with Spe I/Bam HI. The 964 bp Kpn I fragment containing the inverse sequence separated by the linker was inserted into pUAST. Prior to transformation, the construct was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing.\n              Results\n                           Drosophila Nibbler belongs to the exonuclease D family\n                In search for 3'-5' exonuclease domain-containing proteins within the Drosophila genome, we came across a transcript, originally termed CG9247 by the Drosophila sequencing consortium (BDGP; [9], which contained a typical 3'-5' exonuclease domain found in many proteins from worms to humans (Fig. 1a), subsequently termed nibbler (nbr) [23, 32]. Analysis of the nbr open reading frame (ORF) revealed a protein of 625 amino acids with two domains shared by other proteins in the animal kingdom. At the amino terminus, there is no indication of a signal peptide indicative of a secreted or a transmembrane protein, suggesting that it is an intracellular protein. The first third of the protein (amino acids 1-181) does not contain any homology to any known protein, while the second third (amino acids 182-409) contains low homology to human protein FLJ20433 and C. elegans nuclease ZK1098.3. The last third of the protein contains the 3'-5' exonuclease domain which was the initial searching bait. This domain is a widespread domain found in diverse proteins such as human Werner syndrome protein [51] or E. coli RNaseD [52]. Due to the fact that human FLJ20433 and C. elegans ZK1098.3 contain a similar domain arrangement as CG9247 and because lengths of all three proteins are similar, we presume that these three proteins represent the respective nbr orthologues.\n                Analysis of the nbr 3'-5' exonuclease domain revealed that the sequence homology is fairly good (Fig. 1b), in particular the absolutely preserved amino acids that are the typical characteristics of an exonuclease domain. This domain is part of a large DEDD subfamily of exoribonucleases [53], owing to the fact that they contain invariant acidic amino acids at certain position such as the aspartic acid D and the glutamic acid E within domain I (Fig. 1b) and two aspartic acids D in domain II and III, respectively (Fig. 1b). This DEDD subfamily includes the proof-reading domains of many DNA polymerases as well as other DNA exonucleases and shares a common catalytic mechanism characterized by the involvement of two metal ions [44]. Of the different members of the DEDD subfamily, the Nbr protein resembles most the RNaseD proteins which further subdivide the DEDD subfamily into the DEDDy sub-subfamily [53], due to the presence of an invariant tyrosine Y within the catalytic domain III (Fig. 1b).\n              \n                           nbr exhibits nuclease activity\n                To explore the function and activity of the exonuclease domain, we inactivated the domain through a change of the invariant amino acid D to N within the catalytic domain I (highlighted in Fig. 1b, c), and by fusing the enhanced green-fluorescent protein (EGFP) to this altered Nbr protein as an EGFP-Nbr-N fusion protein (Fig. 1e). We then used the Drosophila wing imaginal disc as a model tissue to test the nuclease activity of Nbr and its catalytic-dead variant, Nbr-N, by using the GAL4/UAS over-expression system [3]. We over-expressed Nbr-EGFP in the proximal part of the wing disc using the apterous-(ap) GAL4 line which drives transgenes in the proximal compartment (P) of the wing. In ap-GAL4 > UAS-Nbr-EGFP wing discs, we detected strong nuclease activity in the proximal compartment of the wing disc (Fig. 2d). Upon propidium-iodine (PI) staining, we observed substantial nucleic acid (NA) degradation in the proximal compartment such that only the green color from the EGFP–Nbr fusion protein remained visible. Moreover, this NA degradation led to extensive apoptosis, demonstrated by a collapsed proximal part of the wing disc. Conversely, the distal part was not affected by the ectopic expression of Nbr and thus appeared normal. These data suggest that Nbr is an potent nuclease. Conversely, a mutant form of Nbr, Nbr-N, is unable to exert any nuclease activity upon over-expression with ap-GAL4 (Fig. 2e). Hence, even though Nbr is overexpressed in the proximal compartment, it shows intact cells, evidenced by positive staining of PI, intact NA and the change of the merged color of PI and EGFP into yellow. Moreover, this defective nuclease activity does not compromise cell survival, therefore the shape of the proximal part of the wing disc appears normal.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Embryonic expression, cellular location and nuclease activity of Nbr. a in situ hybridization of a wild type stage 2 embryo (stages are according to [7].

Nucleic acids are stained with propidium iodine (PI, red). d EGFP-Nbr protein expressed in the proximal compartment (P) is an active nuclease and degrades nuclei, hence PI disappears and only EGFP remains. Note also the extensive shrinking of the P part of the wing upon nuclease activity. The distal compartment (D) is not affected, hence PI is visible. (E) Fusion protein with the disrupted catalytic domain (EGFP-Nbr-N) does not reveal any nuclease activity. Hence, PI remains and merges with EGFP to yellow color. Discs in (d) and (e) are oriented with P to the top and D to the bottom\n                      \n              Localization of the nbr mRNA and protein\n                We employed in situ hybridization to detect the spatial transcript pattern of nbr in Drosophila whole mount embryos. nbr is expressed ubiquitously in the early developing embryo (Fig. 2a), suggesting a maternal deposition, also confirmed by FlyBase [1]. At stage 5, i. e. at cellular blastoderm stage, nbr expression drops considerably, and transcripts are only detected ubiquitously at low level during the remaining embryonic stages (FlyBase, [1]; data not shown). To ease analysis of the localization and function of nbr, we constructed EGFP-Nbr flies under control of the GAL/UAS system that allows ectopic expression of any protein [3]. To test the functionality of the EGFP-nbr-N transgene, we monitored the expression of the ectopic transcript driven by the paired (prd)-GAL4 driver using in situ hybridization. As is evident from Fig. 2b, the EGFP-nbr-N transgene is faithfully expressed in 7 stripes, compared to the low-level ubiquitous expression of the endogenous nbr transcripts.\n                To investigate the subcellular localization of the Nbr protein, we first analyzed the EGFP-Nbr wild-type fusion protein in salivary gland cells from third instar larvae using a tubulin (tub)-GAL4 driver line. As evident in Fig. 2c, fluorescence was detected at low levels in the cytoplasm and at a perinuclear localization, similar to the localization of Nbr in the nuage, as described by [24].\n                To evaluate the nature and appearance of the protein, we used an antiserum which was directed against a peptide residing at the NH2-terminal part of the Nbr protein. On Western analysis, a 60 kD band was readily detected in wild-type 4-8 h extracts (Fig. 3k) in agreement with other reports [15]. The intensity of the 60 kD band was substantially increased when Nbr was over-expressed using prd-GAL4 driving an UAS-nbr construct during an identical time interval and upon equal protein amount loaded (Fig. 3k).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Cellular localization of Nbr and Western analysis. a a string of ovaries of different stages stained for Nbr (red) and the nuclear stain DAPI (blue).

A single band of ~60 kD is observed which is upregulated upon over-expression using the prd-GAL4 driver (right lane)\n                      \n                To monitor the subcellular expression, we stained Drosophila tissues using a monoclonal antibody against Nbr [24] along with a nuclear stain, DAPI. We first focused on oogenesis, since nbr was reported to play a critical role during this stage [15, 24]. We detected the protein during the earliest stages in the germarium and in stage 2 oocytes only (Fig. 3a), while all subsequent stages were devoid of Nbr. Using super-resolution microscopy aimed to detect Nbr localization subcellularly and in the nuage [24], the Nbr protein was detected uniformly in the cytoplasm of stage 2 oocytes (Fig. 3b). This localization data are inconsistent with the data of [24]) who reported staining in the nuage surrounding the early nurse cells, but otherwise devoid of any other cellular localization. Moreover, our subcellular Nbr localization data do not entirely fit the localization pattern of EGFP-Nrb (Fig. 2c), however, the data was recorded in two different tissues, the salivary gland vs. the oocyte. Moreover, both the data by [24] and the data of Fig. 2c were based on the use of GFP-Nbr constructs rather than true antibody detection. Hence, we propose that the Nbr-EGFP fusion proteins tend to accumulate in the nuage and thus lead to a misinterpretation of the location where Nbr acts. On the other hand, our antibody data fit another report that revealed Nbr ubiquitous expression in the cytoplasm of oocytes [15] using a Nbr-HA fusion protein and anti HA staining, hence the localization does not include an EGFP-tag, but rather a small and binding-neutral HA-tag. In summary, there are marked differences between the EGFP-Nbr localization and the true antibody staining which question the nuage staining by [24].\n                Later during oogenesis, i. e. during stage, Nrb was detected at low levels at the cortex of the oocyte (Fig. 3e) which persisted during later stages of oogenesis (data not shown). In freshly-laid embryos, the cortical pattern was particularly pronounced (Fig. 3h), due to the strong maternal loading of nbr mRNA (Flybase; [1]. The cortical pattern persisted during early nuclear stages, including nc 11 embryos (Fig. 3i) when the majority of the nuclei have reached the periphery of the blastoderm. At cellular blastoderm, this cortical staining persisted (Fig. 3j), and Nrb was detected on the basal as well as on the apical side of the nuclei, however, at low levels, leaving the nuclei free of Nbr staining.\n              Down-regulation of the nbr nuclease activity can lead to tumor formation.\n                To determine the function of nbr for development, we used a GAL4/UAS-inducible knock-down strategy [29]. To this end, a hairpin cDNA construct (Fig. 1c) was cloned into the pUAST vector [3] and transgenic lines were established. The knockdown activity of this construct was measured in a reverse transcriptase-PCR approach and was found to lead to a 60% reduction of nbr mRNA (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, one of these lines, UAS-nbr\n                           i\n                  37 showed incidences of melanotic tumors (Fig. 4a) or solid tumors (Fig. 4b) (arrows), when crossed to an ubiquitously-expressed tub-GAL4 driver line. Due to the widespread occurrence, we then sought to limit the occurrence of cancer to well-defined areas. To this end, an engrailed (en)-GAL4 driver line which is active in posterior wing compartments (P, Fig. 4d) was crossed to UAS-nbr\n                           i\n                  19, and the wings of the progeny were examined. We found small tumors exclusively in the posterior compartments of the wings (Fig. 4d, arrows), consistent with en expression in the posterior compartment of the wing. Thus, it appeared that down-regulation of nbr increased the incidence of cancer. We reasoned that the activity of Nbr might be needed for control of cell divisions or for control of activity of transposons which randomly affect the activity of cell cycle regulators. Alternatively, the increase of incidences of melanotic tumors in nbr-depleted tissues could be a consequence of the impairment of normal aging processes as previously reported by [15].\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Increased tumor formation in nbr knock-downs.

Tumors are found primarily in the posterior compartment. The green dashed line represents the anterior/posterior (A/P) compartment boundary\n                      \n              Knockdown of nbr reduces the effect of RNAi\n                Next, we pondered if nbr might be involved in mechanisms of the RNAi machinery. For this reason, we set up two parallel assay systems, a cell-culture based system and a transgenic fly approach to test if nbr is involved in RNAi. Drosophila Schneider cells S2 were transfected with a reporter plasmid driving EGFP by an actin promoter. In parallel, two RNA\n                           i\n                  , one against the RNA of EGFP and another one against the RNA of a mock gene, LacZ, were applied simultaneously.\n                The expression of the GFP transgene is complete suppressed when the cells are co-transfected with RNA\n                           i\n                   against EGFP, or RNA\n                           i\n                   against EGFP and RNA\n                           i\n                   against the mock gene lacZ (Fig. 5a). The efficiency of RNAi is reduced when the mock RNA\n                           i\n                   is substituted with the RNA\n                           i\n                   against nbr (Fig. 5b), demonstrating that suppression of nbr suppresses the RNAi machinery.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        \n                                       nbr knockdown reduces the silencing effect of RNA interference. a and b Reduction of the silencing effect of nbr in S2 cells. a cells transfected with the reporter plasmid pAc-EGFP and RNAi against EGFP and mock RNAi.

In wings of Dg-knockdown flies, PVCs extending more than 50% are observed in ~53% of the wings (see Table 1). In wings of doubly Dg, nbr knockdown flies, this number is increased to ~73%, demonstrating that the RNAi activity of Dg is suppressed by lowered activity of nbr\n                                    \n                      \n                When then assayed nbr function using an in vivo system and took advantage of the fact that knock-down of the Drosophila dystroglycan (Dg) gene affects the formation of the posterior cross vein (PCV) in wings of the progeny of MS1096-GAL4 > UAS-Dg\n                           i\n                   flies (Fig. 5c, arrows) [13]. In this genetic combination, the variability of loss of PCV tissue ranged from total absence to slight reduction, as indicated in Table 1. In ~30% of the flies, a complete reduction of the PCV was observed (Fig. 5c), while in ~16% of the cases, the PCV was present half-way (Fig. 5d). In about 53% of the cases, more than half of the PCV was present (Fig. 5e). However, when nbr was knocked-down using UAS-nbr\n                           i\n                  37 flies, the loss of PCV was greatly ameliorated and only ~15% showed complete PCV loss (Table 1). More than 72% of the flies showed more than half of the PCV present, compared to 53% in UAS-Dg\n                           i\n                   (Table 1). An unrelated gene, GC3505, a serine protease not involved in wing development (C. Castillejo-Lopez, unpublished), did not significantly alter the loss of PCV upon knock-down in the same genetic background, as compared to the UAS-Dg\n                           i\n                   reference flies (Table 1). This data demonstrated that lowering nbr activity caused a reduction of the effect of RNAi. It also suggested that the exonuclease activity of nbr was tightly linked to the process of RNAi.Table 1\n                        Occurrence of posterior cross vein (PCV) in Dg knockdown flies, assayed together with 3 different genetic backgrounds\n                      GenotypePCV < 5%PCV < 50%PCV > 50%Total wings\n                                            MS1096-GAL4 > Dg \n                                             i\n                              /Y; ftl \n                                             i\n                              /+30.1%16.5%53.4%402\n                                            MS1096-GAL4 > Dg \n                                             i\n                              /Y; 3505-2a \n                                             i\n                              /+37.5%7.6%54.9%662\n                                            MS1096-GAL4 > Dg \n                                             i\n                              /Y; nbr \n                                             i\n                              37/+14.9%12.4%72.7%442\n                      Allelic classes are subdivided into 3 classes: those flies that show <5% PCV occurrence, those <50% PCV occurrence and those with >50% occurrence.

Lane 1 and 2 show that 54% of all flies have 50% or more PCV tissue present. Lane 3, in doubly ds-nbr; ds-Dg flies, this value increased to 73%, indicating that lowering nbr activity suppresses the knock-down activity on Dg, suggesting that nbr interferes with the RNAi machinery\n                    \n              \n                           nbr affects the levels of transposon RNA intermediates\n                The close similarity of Nbr to C. elegans Mut-7 (Fig. 1), a gene involved in TE silencing, and the elevated levels in occurrence of tumors in Fig. 4 prompted us to investigate if theses tumors were caused by elevated levels of transposon activity. We reasoned that the increased TE hopping frequency into genes regulating cell cycles would ultimately lead to an increase of incidences of tumors. It is well known that the Drosophila germ line is constantly exposed to high activity of transposons [33, 38, 50], hence, mechanisms must exist that limit the hopping of transposons. We therefore investigated the activity of TEs within the female germ line and compared the intermediate RNA level of the copia transposons in wild-type and nbr knock-down ovaries. As is evident in Fig. 6, the level of copia RNA intermediates is 33% higher in nbr\n                           i ovaries compared to wild-type ovaries after 31 PCR cycles, after calibration with a reference gene, rp 49. However, after 34 nuclear cycles, the PCR reaction is close to saturation and only a 1% increase was observed, after calibration with rp 49. These semi-quantitate data suggests that nbr serves as a suppressor of copia. Moreover, a comparison between tissues revealed that the relative rate of transposition is considerably higher in ovaries, compared to that of whole adult females (Fig. 6, Aw).\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        \n                                       nbr ablation increases retro-element RNA intermediates.

The length of the target genes is indicated to the left\n                      \n              DiscussionUsing in vivo studies and by exploiting the GAL4/UAS system in Drosophila, we have analyzed the function of the Nibbler protein for development and for cellular mechanisms. We have undisclosed novel functions of this protein which suggest more wide-spread functions than hitherto anticipated.Data from Fig. 2 indicate that Nibbler possesses a general nuclease activity and is probably more widely involved in cellular activities than only involved in trimming small RNA ends [23, 32]. This result is not surprising, as the protein possesses an exonuclease domain, however, this report shows for the first time that Nbr shows a broader involvement in trimming mRNAs. Discussed as a possibility by [15] that Nbr affects the length of not only miRNAs, but also that of piRNAs, it was speculated that Nbr could potentially trim the 3' ends of a much broader species of RNA substrates, including other long and short noncoding RNAs and mRNAs. However, presumed to be instructive for the piRNA pathway, nbr has received little attention in the context of general function of RNA trimming.Nbr appears to control the expression levels of TEs, as exemplified by copia in Fig. 6. As noted by [49], copia expression is also increased in nbr mutants which is in line with our observation (Fig. 6) that nbr controls the activity of TEs. Whether the regulation is direct or indirect via the piwi pathway which is involved in regulating the levels of TEs in germ cells, in currently unknown, but we favor an involvement of the piwi pathway.Our data on Fig. 4 indicated that knock-down of nbr provokes the formation of tumors. Our current hypothesis is that ablation of nbr increases the rate of transposition. In these cases, the piRNA pathway is probably not involved, as the pathway is restricted to germ cells and extremely little piwi expression was observed during larval stages (Flybase; [1]. Instead, we envision that nbr is involved in the miRNA pathway, by controlling any of the multi-isoform miRNAs that are expressed during larval and pupal stage [23, 32]. These are then thought to control genes regulating cell-cycles or cell-cycle check points.Since a while, it is known that miRNAs are involved in tumorigenesis, where the focus is mainly in humans [25, 30, 45]. To date, in Drosophila, only a handful of miRNA genes are known to be involved in the formation of cancer. One of them is the bantam gene, identified by a conventional gain of function screen which constitutes a miRNA gene that positively regulates cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis – two features typical of oncogenes [5, 26]. However, with the advent of the availability of systematic studies by applying inducible Drosophila miRNA transgenes, scores of uncovered of surprisingly specific, dominant phenotypes were discovered [2, 16]. These surveys suggest that miRNA gain of function may generate diseases much more frequently than miRNA loss of function.Our sensitive assay on Dg-RNAi-mediated depletion of the posterior cross vein (PCV) of Fig. 5c-e and Table 1 confirms a direct involvement of nbr in RNAi-mediated gene silencing. If nbr is reduced, the activity of the RNAi machinery is weakened and depletion of PCV structures is reduced substantially. Likewise, we could confirm the mechanistic action of nbr in cell culture assays which revealed that effect of RNAi was weakened when nbr activity was compromised (Fig. 5b). Hence, for the first time, we can demonstrate that nbr is involved in patterning processes involving whole tissues. Moreover, our data demonstrate that nbr is part of a general RNAi machinery and not just involved in trimming selected miRNAs [23, 32].In the past, there has been considerable disagreement as to the localization of Nbr [15, 24]. The nuage-based localization of Nbr [24], based on its involvement in the piwi-pathway was born by the necessity to reveal colocalization of Nbr with Aub/Ago3 in the nuage, and to adapt its localization to fit the model. Arguably, for localization studies, it is not recommended to use a fusion protein involving EGFP as in [24], as it can lead to substantial localization artefacts due to oligomerization [35, 41]. Consistent with this observation was the fact that our EGFP-Nbr fusion protein, apart from general cytoplasmic localization, also showed perinuclear localization in 3rd instar salivary glands (Fig. 2c), similar to the EGFP-Nbr localization reported in the nuage [24]. In fact, there is not an immediate necessity to describe Nbr enrichment in the nuage as claimed by [24]. Instead, it would have sufficed to imply ubiquitous Nbr localization which also includes localization in the nuage, in order to fulfill the model. This argument was put forward by [15] who observed ubiquitous Nbr localization within oocytes as well, however, their expression profile differed slightly from ours and Nbr was reported to be ubiquitously expressed beyond oocyte stage 2. Ubiquitous Nbr expression rather than accumulation in the nuage also makes sense from another perspective: Given the wide-spread involvement [15, 49] (this report), the function of Nbr is needed in the whole cytoplasm and not just in the nuage.ConclusionsWe have shown that nbr is a tumor suppressor gene, and that the protein is involved in the RNAi machinery and controls the levels of transposons. Nbr is expressed only during a short time window during oogenesis and is not enriched in the nuage. Hence, we have described novel functions of nbr that go beyond from what was expected from previous knowledge on the mode of action of nbr. The ubiquitous localization of Nrb in oocytes necessitates a further careful analysis as to the mode of action of this protein. While it is not excluded that indeed it localizes to the nuage, it is not the sole subcellular location where Nbr resides which asks for further functions of this protein in other areas of the cytoplasm. Moreover, our data will encourage studies to show that Nbr is involved in many cellular processes.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsS.

In fruits, sugar metabolism and accumulation are important factors for fruit organoleptic quality. Post-harvest ripening is a special feature of ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, transcriptome sequencing based on the Illumina platform generated 23.8 - 35.8 million unigenes of nine cDNA libraries constructed using RNAs from the ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ pear variety with different treatments, in which 2629 new genes were discovered, and 2121 of them were annotated. A total of 2146 DEGs, 3650 DEGs, 1830 DEGs from each comparison were assembled. Moreover, the gene expression patterns of 8 unigenes related to sugar metabolism revealed by qPCR. The main constituents of soluble sugars were fructose and glucose after pear fruit post-harvest ripening, and five unigenes involved in sugar metabolism were discovered.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our study not only provides a large-scale assessment of transcriptome resources of ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ but also lays the foundation for further research into genes correlated with sugar metabolism.\n              KeywordsPear (Pyrus communis L.)Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)RNA-SeqSugar determinationBackgroundPear (Pyrus spp.), one of the most important and oldest temperate fruit tree species (belonging to the subfamily Pomoideae in the family Rosaceae), has been grown in temperate regions since antiquity in both Europe and China [1]. A large number of pear cultivars are functional diploids (2n = 34). The primary edible pear species are the Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai), the European pear (P. communis L.) and Chinese pears (P. bretschneideri Rehd. and P. ussuriensis Maxim.), which are grown for commercial fruit production. The Japanese pear and Chinese pears are grown in East Asia, while the European pear is cultivated in Europe and other temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere [2].Improving fruit quality has become an important direction of fruit tree cultivation. In fruits, sugar metabolism and accumulation are important factors for fruit organoleptic quality. Sugar, the primary product of photosynthesis and a substrate of respiration, is required for carbon skeleton construction and energy supply in plants [3]. Sugars are known to play key roles in both plant metabolic and defense responses as signaling molecules [4–8]. Moreover, soluble sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) are important components of fruit taste, directly influencing consumer preferences for fresh fruit [9]. Glucose and fructose take part in cell division, and sucrose is actively involved in differentiation and maturation [10]. It has been reported that the levels and ratios of these sugars differ in various tree species and rely on the major catalytic enzymes in sugar metabolism [11]. Soluble acid invertase (INV) converts sucrose into fructose and glucose [12]. In pear and many other woody Rosaceae plants, photosynthetic products, primarily in the form of sorbitol, are produced by leaves and transported to the fruit and other organs, which leads to the invertase-catalyzed hydrolysis of sorbitol to glucose and fructose [3]. It is well known that environmental factors (such as temperature and light) have a certain impact on sugar metabolism in post-harvest fruit [7]. For example, Wang [13] showed that peach fruit stored at 5 °C produced lower levels of sucrose and higher levels of glucose and fructose than fruit stored at 0 °C. It is well documented that the accumulation of soluble sugars could be improved by modifying the enzymatic activity of sucrose metabolism of post-harvest lemon fruit after exposure to UV-B [14]. Transcriptome sequencing has become a powerful tool to profile transcriptomes due to its reproducibility, sensitivity, high throughput, low cost and accuracy [15]. Transcriptome sequencing is an effective technique for the acquisition of sequences for new genes and provides opportunities to study specific cellular pathways and gene expression patterns [16–18]. In this work, expression data regarding differentially expressed genes were analyzed, and the respective putative functions of the sequences were identified through the described screening process. Our study aimed to provide important information for further functional studies of novel genes of ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ related to sugar metabolism and accumulation using RNA-Seq technology.MethodsPlant materials and treatments\n                The plant materials of ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ (Pyrus communis L.) used in this study were obtained from Zhengzhou Fruit Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Henan Province, China. Group 1 (T04, T07 and T10) of the pear pulps was collected at maturity. Group 2 (T05, T08 and T11) of the pear pulps was subjected to low temperature (5 °C) for 10 days after picking. Group 3 (T06, T09 and T12) was treated at normal temperature (25 °C) for 3 days after treatment at low temperature (5 °C, 10 days), the fruit went soft. All of the treatments were performed using three replicates with three fruits for each replicate. All collected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until RNA extraction.\n              RNA extraction and cDNA library construction\n                The extraction of RNA, construction of cDNA libraries and the transcriptome sequencing assay were performed by Biomarker Biotechnology Corporation (Beijing, China). RNA degradation and contamination were checked on 1% agarose gels. RNA purity and concentration were measured using the NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA) and Qubit RNA Assay Kit in Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The library quality was monitored on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The first-strand cDNA synthesis for qPCR was obtained by the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa, Japan).\n              Data analysis and functional annotation\n                Clean data (clean reads) were acquired by trimming reads containing adapters and those containing poly-N and low-quality reads from raw data. Concurrently, the Q20, Q30, GC content and sequence duplication levels of the clean data were calculated. All the analyses were based on clean data with high quality. Gene function was annotated based on the following downstream databases: Nr (NCBI non-redundant protein sequences); Nt (NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequences); Pfam (Protein family); KOG/COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins); Swiss-Prot (a manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database); KO (KEGG Ortholog database); and GO (Gene Ontology). GO and KEGG were also used to classify unigene functions. In addition, the complex biological behaviors of unigenes and pathway annotation for unigenes were further studied by KEGG annotation. Quantification of gene expression levels was estimated by fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) using the following formula:$$ \\mathrm{FPKM}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cDNA}\\  \\mathrm{Fragments}}{\\mathrm{Mapped}\\  \\mathrm{Fragments}\\left(\\mathrm{Millions}\\right)\\times \\mathrm{Transcript}\\  \\mathrm{Length}\\left(\\mathrm{kb}\\right)} $$\n                        \n                In this formula, cDNA Fragments represents the number of fragments that aligned to a specific transcript. Mapped Fragments (Millions) represents the total number of fragments that aligned to all transcripts. Transcript Length (kb) represents the length of the transcript.\n              Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)\n                Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups were identified using the DESeq R package. DESeq provides statistical routines for determining differential expression in digital gene expression data using a negative binomial distribution model. The resulting P values were adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for controlling the false discovery rate. Genes with an adjusted P-value <0.05 found by DESeq were considered differentially expressed.\n              Real-time quantitative PCR analysis and sugar content determination\n                Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol of the SYBR Green I Master (ROX) (Roche, USA) using the LightCycler480 real-time PCR system (Roche, USA). The qPCR procedure was as follows: 50 °C, 2 min; 95 °C, 10 min; and 40 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s and 60 °C, 60 s. The qPCR results were analyzed by the 2-<U+25B3><U+25B3>Ct method [19]. Tubulin (AB239681) was used as the reference gene. The primers for selected DEGs and tubulin are shown in Table 1 and were designed using Beacon Designer7 and synthesized by GENEWIZ (Suzhou, China).Table 1\n                        The primers for selected DEGs and Tubulin\n                      GeneForward primer (5'-3')Reverse primer (5'-3')PCP011895CTTCAAGGATTGCCACATTGTATCGTATTATTCAAGTAGAGGPCP005049ACATCACAATAGGTTCTGTCTCAACTTCACATTCTGPCP013141AACCACCTCTTCTGATGAACCACAAGTAGTCTGTAGTAPCP008001GGTCATATTCCTCTTGTCATTAGTTGTTCTGGCACTGTCTTPCP030959TCGGTCATATTCCTCTTGTCTTGTTCTGGCACTGTCTTPCP006674GCTTGGTCTTGAATATGACGGCAGAATCTTAATGTAPCP005278TAGCCAGAGCAATAAGGAGGAGTTCGTTCAAGTGTTPCP012345GTAGCAGTGGATTCATAGCGCATCAGTAGCATTGGTTnewGene_4807CAAGAAGCAGCAAGAGAACACTAGGAATCAAGGCATCPCP005062GCTTCTGTTGTTATCTCCTCTATTCCACCACTGCTGATTGTubulinTGGGCTTTGCTCCTCTTACCCTTCGTGCTCATCTTACC\n                A 100 mg sample of each pear was weighed and extracted for LC-ESI-MS/MS of sugar content determination. Methanol, acetonitrile and ethanol were purchased from Merck Company (Germany). Standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, were dissolved in methanol and preserved at -20 °C for LC-MS analysis.\n              ResultsSequencing\n                Nine cDNA libraries, T04, T07, T10, T05, T08, T11, T06, T09 and T12, were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, which generated a total of 23.8 - 35.8 million clean reads of each library after data filtering and stringent quality investigation (Table 2). The GC content of each clean data was below 50%, with a quality score (Q30) percentage above 94% (Table 2), demonstrating that the reliability and quality of the sequencing data were adequate for further analysis. The ratio of mapped reads ranged from 74.37% to 76.99% (Table 2). Based on the mapped results, 2629 new genes were discovered, and 2121 of them were annotated (Table 3). In addition, 27 DEGs, 44 DEGs, 171 DEGs and 197 DEGs fall into “up-up”, “down-down”, “down-up” and “down-up” pattern along with three treatments (G1 vs. G2 vs. G3), respectively (Table 4).Table 2\n                        Summary statistics of Illumina sequencing for ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’\n                      SamplesClean readsGC Content% = Q30Mapped reads ratioT0423,800,72447.34%94.28%76.02%T0535,882,93047.03%94.78%75.87%T0629,358,47847.44%94.75%74.40%T0731,642,03347.49%94.74%76.99%T0829,876,59847.55%94.15%75.30%T0926,183,44247.21%94.69%74.37%T1033,015,52146.83%94.83%76.61%T1132,051,41747.10%95.12%76.99%T1230,183,23947.33%94.54%75.75%\n                      Clean reads represent total pair-end reads of clean data; Mapped reads ratio represents the percent of clean data mapped to the pear reference genome (http://www.rosaceae.org/species/pyrus/pyrus_communis/genome_v1.0)\n                    Table 3\n                        Statistical table for the annotation of new genes\n                      Annotated databasesNew gene numberCOG285GO772KEGG584eggNOG1636nr2114All2121Table 4\n                        Number of DEGs fall into four patterns\n                      PatternsNumber of DEGsUp-up27Down-down44Down-up171Up-down197\n              Analysis of DEGs\n                To obtain DEGs among three biological replicates, the samples were identified via two-two comparisons: Group 1 vs. Group 2 (G1 vs. G2), Group 1 vs. Group 3 (G1 vs. G3) and Group 2 vs. Group 3 (G2 vs. G3). In the G1 vs. G2 comparison, 2146 genes confirmed significantly different expression, including 793 DEGs that were up-regulated and 1353 DEGs that were down-regulated (Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows that there were 1220 up-regulated and 2430 down-regulated DEGs in the G1 vs. G3 comparison. Among the 1830 DEGs in the G2 vs. G3 comparison, 810 DEGs were up-regulated and 1020 DEGs were down-regulated. After screening all differentially expressed genes, we constructed a volcano plot to observe the DEGs more clearly (Fig. 2).\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Differentially expressed genes in each comparison\n                      \n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in each comparison.

The total number of unigenes among all three comparisons was 32,255, including 1630 DEGs in the G1 vs. G2 comparison, 2790 DEGs in the G1 vs. G3 comparison and 1419 DEGs in the G2 vs. G3 comparison, which were assigned to three main GO categories, which included biological process, molecular function and cellular component (Fig. 3). All of them were assigned to 53 functional groups using GO assignments (Fig. 3). Figure 3a shows that the DEGs in the G1 vs. G2 comparison were significantly enriched in GO terms such as “signaling”, “growth” and “rhythmic process” in the “biological process” category; “extracellular region” in the “cellular component” category; and “nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity” and “protein binding transcription factor activity” in the “molecular function” category. Figure 3b shows that DEGs of “rhythmic process” and “locomotion” in the “biological process” category, “extracellular matrix” and “extracellular matrix part” in the “cellular component” category, and “protein binding transcription factor activity” and “nutrient reservoir activity” in the “molecular function” category were found to be significantly enriched in the GO terms in the G1 vs. G3 comparison. Figure 3c shows that DEGs in the G2 vs. G3 comparison were significantly enriched in GO terms such as “rhythmic process” and “locomotion” in the “biological process” category; “extracellular region part”, “extracellular matrix”, “extracellular matrix part”, “virion” and “virion part” in the “cellular component” category; and “transporter activity”, “nutrient reservoir activity” and “guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity” in the “molecular function” category.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        GO classification of each comparison.

Among the 3650 and 1830 unigenes in the G1 vs. G3 comparison and G2 vs. G3 comparison, 1412 and 687 unigenes could be annotated to the KEGG, including 74 and 40 annotated unigenes related to sugar metabolism (fructose and mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism and starch and sucrose metabolism), respectively (Fig. 4). Figure 4 shows that half of the unigenes between G1 and G2 were similarly expressed, and similar results were found between G2 and G3. Two unigenes were expressed in all three groups (Fig. 4).\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Numbers of DEGs related to sugar metabolism in the three groups\n                      \n                To validate the reliability and accuracy of the RNA-Seq results, 8 candidate genes associated with sugar metabolism (galactose metabolism and starch and sucrose metabolism) were randomly selected for RT-qPCR assays, including 6 up-regulated unigenes (PCP005049, PCP006674, PCP008001, PCP011895, PCP013141 and PCP030959) (Fig. 5a–c) and 2 down-regulated unigenes (PCP005278 and a novel gene, 004807) (Fig. 5d). The details of these unigenes are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1, the pathways which they involved in are shown in Additional file 2: Figure S1 and Additional file 3: Figure S2. The results from the qPCR analysis demonstrated that nearly all of these genes showed similar expression trends to those of RNA-Seq (Fig. 5a–d).\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        \n                                       a Expression of PCP005049 gene and PCP006674 gene as determined by RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR; b Expression of PCP008001 gene and PCP011895 gene as determined by RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR; c Expression of PCP013141 gene and PCP030959 gene as determined by RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR; d Expression of new gene 004807 and PCP005278 gene as determined by RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR. The details of above genes were showed in Table S1. Tubulin (AB239681) was used as the reference gene. The pear reference genome was on <http://www.rosaceae.org/species/pyrus/pyrus_communis/genome_v1.0>\n                      \n              Analysis of sugar content and related genes\n                As Fig. 6a shows, the main constituents of soluble sugars, which consisted of fructose and glucose, were increased gradually, while sorbitol was decreased with the pear fruit post-harvest ripening process. In addition, sucrose was increased first and then decreased. Fructose was the most abundant soluble sugar during the pear post-harvest ripening period (G1-G2-G3) in pear (Fig. 6a). Sorbitol was the second most abundant soluble sugar at fruit maturation (G1) (Fig. 6a).\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        \n                                       a Sugar (glucose, sorbitol, sucrose and fructose) content in ‘Red Clapp’ pears during different periods; b The correlation between fructose content and its related unigenes’ expression; c The correlation between glucose content and its related unigenes’ expression\n                      \n                Five of the abovementioned unigenes that were related to sugar metabolism were selected. The relative expression of two unigenes (PCP030959 and PCP008001) increased rapidly with the increase in fructose content (Fig. 6b). The unigene PCP013141 was significantly increased with the increase in glucose content (Fig. 6c). The unigene PCP005278 showed a small increase with the increase in glucose content (Fig. 6c).\n              DiscussionRNA-Seq is a feasible and economical way to detect genes of interest in a short time, and its popularity among researchers continues to increase [20–22]. In modern times, transcript information, gene structure and functional annotation, alternative splicing, and DEGs can be obtained by RNA-Seq technology [23, 24]. This technology has been widely applied to model and non-model species, such as Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) [25], rice (Oryza sativa) [26, 27], cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) [28], licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch) [29], Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi [30], and Chinese wolfberry (Lycium chinense Mill.) [31]. In this study, a total of 23.8 - 35.8 million clean reads were obtained from 9 cDNA libraries using this technology (Table 2) and were assembled into a total of 2146 DEGs, 3650 DEGs, and 1830 DEGs, respectively, from each comparison (Fig. 1).Great taste is a prerequisite for consumer satisfaction [32]. Pear eating quality is influenced by climatic conditions, post-storage ripening and harvest time [33]. Physiological maturity of ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ is the stage of development when the fruit ripens adequately after harvest [34]. Hence, fruit ripening processes are very important because they influence the changes that appear during fruit storage, transport and shelf life and changes in aroma and color [35]. Sugar metabolism is an important part of the pear ripening process. In this research, we used RNA-Seq technology to study DEGs in the ripening process. These DEGs showed functional diversity. In the GO functional analysis, DEGs were involved in extracellular region, extracellular region part, extracellular matrix, extracellular matrix part, virion and virion part of the cellular component category (Fig. 3a–c). The DEGs were involved in molecular function categories such as nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity, protein binding transcription factor activity, protein binding transcription factor activity, nutrient reservoir activity, transporter activity, nutrient reservoir activity and guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity (Fig. 3a–c). The DEGs were also involved in the biological process category, including signaling, growth, rhythmic process and locomotion (Fig. 3a–c). All of these results show that sugar metabolism is a complex physiological and biochemical process.We analyzed the eight differentially expressed unigenes related to sugar metabolism with qPCR, and the results showed similar expression trends to those of RNA-Seq (Fig. 5a–d). Only the multiple of up-regulated or down regulated was different, which validated that the RNA-Seq analysis was generally more accurate and robust. Soluble sugars, including fructose, sucrose, glucose and sorbitol, are an important factor in determining fruit quality and flavor. Fructose showed the highest sweetness, followed by sucrose; the sweetness of glucose and sorbitol was the lowest. Chen et al. showed that fructose was the dominant sugar in eight pear varieties, followed by glucose and sucrose [36]. In this study, fructose was the main sugar after pear post-harvest ripening, followed by glucose, sucrose and sorbitol. This result might indicate that fructose is the key factor in the pear eating quality of ‘Red Clapp’ (Fig. 6a). Interestingly, we discovered five unigenes that might be involved in sugar metabolism (Fig. 6b, c). In future studies, we plan to clone the specific genes related to sugar metabolism and verify their functions.ConclusionsIn this study, transcriptome sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform, generating 23.8 - 35.8 million unigenes of nine cDNA libraries constructed using RNAs from the ‘Red Clapp’s Favorite’ pear variety with different treatments. A number of DEGs and novel genes were obtained from each group and were assembled. Moreover, the gene expression patterns of 8 unigenes related to sugar metabolism revealed by qPCR confirmed the RNA-Seq data. The main constituents of soluble sugars were fructose and glucose after pear fruit post-harvest ripening, and five unigenes involved in sugar metabolism were discovered.

In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), several hundreds of short-culm mutants have been isolated over the years. The objective of the present study was to identify the Brachytic1 (Brh1) semi-dwarfing gene and to test its effect on yield and malting quality.\n              \n                Results\n                Double-haploid lines generated through a cross between a brh1.a mutant and the European elite malting cultivar Quench, showed good malting quality but a decrease in yield. Especially the activities of the starch degrading enzymes ß-amylase and free limit dextrinase were high. A syntenic approach comparing markers in barley to those in rice (Oryza sativa L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench) and brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon P. Beauv) helped us to identify Brh1 as an orthologue of rice D1 encoding the Ga subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein. We demonstrated that Brh1 is allelic to Ari-m. Sixteen different mutant alleles were described at the DNA level.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Mutants in the Brh1 locus are deficient in the Ga subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein, which shows that heterotrimeric G proteins are important regulators of culm length in barley. Mutant alleles do not have any major negative effects on malting quality.\n              Keywords\n                Ari-i\n              \n                Ari-m\n              \n                Brh1\n              \n                Hordeum vulgare\n              Semi-dwarfBackgroundSemi-dwarfism is regarded as a valuable trait in cereal breeding, as cultivars with a short stature show increased lodging resistance [6, 25]. Due to the potential agronomic usefulness, many different types of semi-dwarf mutants have been identified in barley (Hordeum vulgare) during the last 70 years. These semi-dwarf mutants have obtained different names since they often have other pleiotropic characters which might have been in focus of the involved research group. The major semi-dwarf subgroups are Brachytic (Brh), Breviaristatum (Ari), Slender dwarf (Sld), Erectoides (Ert), Semidwarf (Sdw), Semi-brachytic (Uzu) and Dense spike (Dsp) [10]. However, only a few barley semi-dwarfing genes have successfully been applied in breeding programs – The uzu1.a allele was one of the first short-culm alleles to be used [31] and has been introduced in almost all Japanese hull-less barley cultivars [26]; two different alleles of the Semidwarf 1 gene, sdw1.c (originally named denso) and sdw1.d, are most likely the dominating short-culm alleles in the today’s European elite cultivars [10]; ert-k.32 was isolated after X-ray treatment in the cultivar Bonus and released as the cultivar Pallas [13]; ari-e.GP was isolated after <U+03B3>-ray mutagenesis of cultivar Maythorpe in 1956 and released as Golden Promise [1, 12]; sdw4.ba was isolated after <U+03B3>-ray treatment of the Chinese cultivar Zhenongguangmangerleng in the late 1960s and is now probably widespread in many semi-dwarf barley accessions in China through the cultivar released as Zhepi 1 [37, 38].Plant hormones like gibberellic acid (GA) and brassinosteroids (BR) are the major regulators of plant height. It is therefore not surprising that successful “Green revolution” semi-dwarfing genes can be exemplified by Reduced height1 (Rht1) in wheat encoding a transcriptional regulator with a DELLA domain involved in GA signaling [23], Semi-dwarf1 (Sd1) in rice [3, 28] and Sdw1 in barley [36] both deficient in a gibberellin 20-oxidase of the GA biosynthetic pathway, and Uzu1 in barley encoding the brassinosteroid receptor [7, 9].An interesting mutant, not only in the context of plant breeding but also for identification of genetic factors determining plant height, is brachytic1 (brh1), which was originally identified after a spontaneous mutation event in the barley cultivar Himalaya [24, 30]. Outgrown plants have an upright gross morphology with short leaves, culms, spikes, awns and kernels, and their seedling leaf is reduced in length (Fig. 1). The mutant phenotype is easy to classify at all stages of growth (www.nordgen.org/bgs). In total, ten recessive brh1 alleles have been isolated in a wide range of different genetic backgrounds. One allele was previously classified as ari-i but shown to be allelic to brh1 through diallelic crosses [33] (Table 1). Brh1 was mapped to chromosome 7HS and is inherited in a monofactorial recessive manner [24, 30]. Eight of the ten brh1 alleles are further available as near-isogenic lines through recurrent backcrosses to the two-row spring barley cultivar Bowman (Table 1) [11]. Trait analysis of brh1 mutants in the genetic background of Bowman showed that several brh1 alleles reduce lodging without causing significant yield reduction [8]. In addition, the globe-shaped form of brh1 mutant seeds could also be of potential value; such seed form is generally preferred by maltsters as it is associated with an even germination in the malt house. However, the overall effect of brh1 mutations on malting is currently unknown. Still, when elucidating if brh1 alleles could indeed serve as an alternative dwarfing gene in barley, it is of particular importance to exclude a negative impact of the mutation on malting quality.\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Phenotype of brh1 mutants in barley compared to the respective mother cultivar.

We show that Brh1 encodes a subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein and mutant alleles of Brh1 do not have any major negative effects on malting quality. Heterotrimeric G proteins transfer signals from receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors) to downstream enzymes (effectors) in signaling cascades [32]. The heterotrimeric G protein complex consists of one Ga, one Gß and one G<U+03B3> subunit. Brh1 encodes a Ga subunit. This is especially interesting in the view that it was recently shown that barley Ari-e encodes a G<U+03B3> subunit [35], being orthologous to DEP1 in rice [16]. In addition, barley Brh2 encodes a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, orthologous to TUD1 in rice (Braumann et al. unpublished). TUD1 has been suggested to physically interact with the Ga subunit in rice [15]. Thus, within a short period of time, heterotrimeric G proteins have been identified as a key regulator of plant architecture in barley.MethodsPlant material\n                All mutant lines were obtained from public non-profit organizations or individual contributors: brh1.a, brh1.e, brh1.t, brh1.x, brh1.c and brh1.f from the National Small Grains Collection (U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service, Aberdeen, Idaho, USA); brh1.ae from Andris Kleinhofs, (Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA); ari-i.38 and the eight Bowman near-isogenic lines BW047 (ari-i.38), BW074 (brh1a), BW075 (brh1.aa), BW076 (brh1.ae), BW077 (brh1.e), BW078 (brh1.t), BW079 (brh1.x) and BW080 (brh1.z) from the Nordic Genetic Resource Center (NordGen, Alnarp, Sweden).\n              Phenotypic description of mutant and wild type lines\n                For phenotypic descriptions, plants were grown in the greenhouse under 16-h-light / 8-h-dark cycles. The culm length measured is the distance between the soil and the collar of the spike. Further, the distances from the collar of the spike to the tip of the spike and to the tip of the longest awn was measured. Awn length was normalized to the length of the spike by forming the ratio of [length from spike collar to tip of longest awn] / [length from spike collar to tip of spike]. Per line 12 plants were grown in large square formed pots. The significance of differences in culm length and awn length between mutant lines and respective wild types was tested by a two sided t-test for two independent populations with equal variance assumption in Microsoft Excel. The number of biological replicates was n = 3 (in the case of BW047) to n = 12 depending on the number of seeds that germinated per line.\n              Generation of double-haploid plants\n                In order to transfer brh1.a into a more modern genetic background we performed crosses between the Bowman near-isogenic line BW074 (brh1.a) and the European elite malting cultivar Quench. F1 seeds were subjected to embryo rescue 25 days after fertilization. The outer parts of the husk of the developing grains were removed and the grains were sterilized in 4% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min followed by rinsing in sterile water. The embryos were put onto BAP medium [0.44% (w/v) MS powder (Sigma M5524), 0.075% (w/v) glutamine, 6% maltose (w/v), 1 µg/ml BAP (Sigma B9394) and 0.35% phytagel (w/v), pH 5.8]. After 6 weeks, the developing F1 plants were transferred to soil. Anthers from undeveloped spikes were transferred into a 0.7 M mannitol solution in petri dishes and incubated for 3 days at 24 °C. Then the anthers were transferred on BAP medium and incubated at 24 °C for 8 weeks in darkness. Developing calluses were transferred into containers containing MS sucrose medium (0.22% (w/v) MS, 1.5% (w/v) sucrose) and exposed to light for several days. Regenerating plants that turned green were planted into soil and left for seed formation in the greenhouse.\n              Field tests\n                Field testing was done on the Danish island of Fyn during summers 2013 and 2014 using standard nitrogen fertilizer application for malting barley in plots of 7.5 m2 in size. 3600 grains were sown per experimental plot. All lines were tested in triplicates in randomized plots. The experimental plots were harvested using a combiner. The seeds were cleaned prior to weighing and the fraction above 2.2 mm was kept. The significance of differences in grain yield per plot was tested by a two sided t-test for two independent populations with equal variance assumption in Microsoft Excel.\n              Germination test\n                All barley samples used in the manual malting experiments were evaluated for the parameters Germination index, Germination energy and Water sensitivity. Data was based on a sample size of 100 barley grains for a 4 ml or 8 ml germination test according to Analytica-EBC Method 3.6.2 (http://analytica-ebc.com/index.php?mod=contents&scat=10).\n              Characterization of barley samples\n                Thousand kernel weights were determined by automatic counting using a Data Count JR (Data Technologies, Israel). Size fractionation within four classes (X > 2.8 mm), (2.8 mm < X > 2.5 mm), (2.5 mm < X > 2.2 mm) and (X < 2.2 mm) was done using a Pfeuffer Sortimat K3 (Pfeuffer GmbH, Germany). Size fractionation data was calculated from a 100 g sample. Protein, water and starch content of the barley samples were determined using a near infrared transmittance Foss 1241 NIT instrument (Foss, Denmark) and barley calibration Foss BY213271 provided by the manufacturer. 24 h prior to micro malting, the water content of the 100 g sample was re-determined using the same Foss 1241 NIT instrument but barley calibration Foss BY303300. All samples tested in micro malting experiments in this study were grown in rows in New Zealand from September 2012 to February 2013.\n              Manual micro malting\n                All samples were malted using a manual micro malting system developed in house at the Carlsberg Research Laboratory. The micro malting was performed in a Termaks incubator KB8400 (Termaks AS, Norway) at 13.5 °C during the steeping and germination phase. The barley was malted in individual sample cups each holding 100 g of barley seeds. One batch of seeds was malted per line. The barley samples were steeped as a forced submission of all grains in a closed sample grid chamber for 3 h. The steeping procedure was performed in three 24 h intervals. Time recording started when grains were immersed in water first time and set to 0 h. The second steeping period started after 24 h and third after 48 h. The actual water uptake of the individual barley samples was estimated after a centrifugal removal of water from the sample. Steeping degree was calculated in relation to dry matter of the sample using a Foss 1241 NIT instrument (Foss A/S, Denmark) for determination of dry matter compared to the total sample weight of the sample after centrifugation. Near infrared transmittance is a non-destructive seed analysis, whereby a given chemical compound is assigned to a specific wavelength between 900 – 1050 nm. Based on a calibration of the instrument it is then possible predict the concentration of that given compound. Following the last steep the barley samples were maintained at a steeping degree at approximately 45% during the germination step. After the germination process the barley samples were kiln dried in the Termaks incubator for 21 h. The temperature profile of the kiln process was a two-step ramping profile and an isothermal terminal step monitored by a Eurotherm 815 control unit (Eurotherm by Schneider Electric, USA). First ramping step started at set point 30 °C and a linear ramping at 2 °C / h to the breakpoint at 55 °C. Second linear ramping was at 4 °C / h and reaching a maximum at 82 °C. This temperature was kept constant for 1.5 h. The process was based on a recirculating air flow using 80% fresh air. The kiln samples were cured using a manual root removal system from Wissenschaftliche Station für Brauerei, Munich, Germany. Final malt samples were stored at 20 °C prior to near infrared transmittance analysis and enzyme activity measurement.\n              Malt analysis\n                Analysis of malt samples for water content, protein content, soluble protein and extract were determined with a Foss 1241 NIT (Foss A/S, Denmark) instrument using the Malt calibration Foss MA000010 provided by the manufacturer. Prior to enzyme activity analysis the malt samples were milled using a standard Foss Cyclotech mill (Foss A/S, Denmark) equipped with a tungsten carbide grinding ring (Foss 10,004,463), nickel plated impeller (Foss 1000 2666) and a 1 mm outlet screen (Foss 10,001,989). All enzyme activity measurements of barley malt were made within 48 h after milling of the dry sample.\n              a-amylase activity\n                a-amylase activity of final malt was based on malt flour made according to the sample preparation description in the Malt Analysis section above. a-amylase activity assays were measured using a Ceralpha kit (K-CERA) from Megazyme (Ireland) using standard laboratory equipment. The amylase assays were made according to the manufacturer’s protocol (K-CERA 01/12). Measurements were made in technical duplicates. Calculation of amylase activity was based on the formula in the Megazyme protocol (K-CERA 01/12). The significance of differences in a-amylase activity was tested by a two sided t-test for two independent populations with equal variance assumption in Microsoft Excel comparing the four double haploid lines carrying the brh1.a allele to the three lines in their progeny, BW074, Bowman and Quench.\n              ß-amylase activity\n                ß-amylase activity of final malt was based on malt flour made according to the sample preparation description in the Malt Analysis section above. ß-amylase activity assays were measured using Betamyl kit (K-BETA3) from Megazyme (Ireland) using standard laboratory equipment. The amylase assays were made according to the manufacturer’s protocol (K-BETA3 10/10). Measurements were made in technical duplicates. Calculation of ß-amylase activity was based on the formula in the Megazyme protocol (K-BETA3 10/10). The significance of differences in ß-amylase activity was tested by a two sided t-test for two independent populations with equal variance assumption in Microsoft Excel comparing the four double haploid lines carrying the brh1.a allele to the three lines in their progeny, BW074, Bowman and Quench.\n              Limit dextrinase activity\n                Limit dextrinase activity of final malt was based on malt flour made according to the sample preparation description in the Malt Analysis section above. Limit dextrinase activity assays were measured using a Limit Dextrizyme kit T-LDZ1000 from Megazyme (Ireland) using standard laboratory equipment. The limit dextrinase assays were made according to manufacturer’s protocol T-LDZ1000 07/9. Measurements were made in technical duplicates. Calculation of limit dextrinase activity was based on the formula in the Megazyme protocol T-LDZ1000 07/9. The significance of differences in Limit dextrinase activity was tested by a two sided t-test for two independent populations with equal variance assumption in Microsoft Excel comparing the four double haploid lines carrying the brh1.a allele to the three lines in their progeny, BW074, Bowman and Quench.\n              Public databases\n                Public sequence databases were accessed via the following web pages: “http://www.gramene.org/” for sorghum, “http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/analyses_search_blast.shtml” for rice, and “http://brachypodium.org/” for brachypodium.

The HarvEST database was accessed using the link http://harvest.ucr.edu/.\n              Screening of a pooled BAC library of the barley genome\n                Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones originating from six independent BAC libraries were previously made from the barley cultivar Morex [27] and pooled in multidimensional levels [2]. Primers specific for the Brh1 target region (Table 2) were obtained from Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg (Germany) and were used for a PCR screening of the pooled BAC libraries to identify BAC clones containing the region surrounding the Brh1 gene.Table 2\n                        Oligonucleotides used as PCR primers to amplify and sequence the gene encoding the Ga-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein and to amplify gene fragments located in the genomic region surrounding this gene in a BAC pool screening\n                      Primer nameSequence (5' <U+2192> 3')TemplateLength of amplification product [bp]bw-Fr1-F1TGTCAAGATGATGGCTTCAGGenomic DNA703 (with bw-Fr1-R1)bw_Fr1-FseqAAAAAGACGATGATGAAGCGenomic DNA bw-Fr1-R1GATCGACGAGAGCATGAGACGenomic DNA bw-Fr2-F1GGCGAGGTAGAAAGCAAAAGGenomic DNA790 (with bw-Fr2-R1)bw-Fr2-R1TTTTGAGGTATCCATCCATCTCGenomic DNA bw-Fr3-F1CGCACACAGTCAAAGGAACGenomic DNA896 (with bw-Fr3-R1)bw-Fr3-R1GACAGCATTGCACAAGGAGGenomic DNA bw-Fr4-F1TGTCCCAGATCCTCAAACTGGenomic DNA901 (with bw-Fr4-R1)bw-Fr4-R1TTGTCCCTTGTAAACTGTTGGGenomic DNA bw-Fr5-F1TCCTCCTGCAAAATCTCTCCGenomic DNA903 (with bw-Fr5-R1)bw-Fr5-R1TTAGACTCGGCATTTTGAGGGenomic DNA bw-Fr6-F1ACCTGAATGGCTGGATCTTCGenomic DNA857 (with bw-Fr6-R1)bw-Fr6-R1GCATAGTGGGGATTATTCAGGGenomic DNA bw-Fr7-F1GGTCCAAACAGGTTCAGTTGGenomic DNA824 (with bw-Fr7-R1)bw-Fr7-R1GATTCTGCACGAGACAAAGGGenomic DNA bw-Fr8-F1GGAATCAGTCTTTCCAGATCCGenomic DNA705 (with bw-Fr8-R2)bw-Fr8-R2CCAAAATACCCATACCAACCGenomic DNA bw-Fr9-F1GAGCGAGCCAGAGATTTTGGenomic DNA711 (with bw-Fr9-R1)bw-Fr9-R1TGTATATGACGGAGCAGCAAGGenomic DNA bw_Fr9-RseqGCTTGTTGGTTGTAGCTCAGGenomic DNA IL130CAACAATATGGGCATTACATBAC350 (with IL131)IL131CGAGGAGTTCTACAAATCATBAC IL132CTTGCCCACTTACCAGGTGGBAC300 (with IL133)IL133ACGGGATCTCCTTATGGAGCBAC IL134ATGATCGACTGCTACATCCBAC318 (with IL135)IL135GGTTCTGTCGTTGTACCTAGBAC IL136CACCAAGCAGCAGATGATCBAC152 (with IL137)IL137CCAGTTTGTTGGATGTTTCCBAC IL138GAGGGCTTCTATTGAAAGTGBAC510 (with IL139)IL139GGTACTGACCAACTGTTACGBAC IL140AAAAGGCTGACTCAAAGACCBAC318 (with IL141)IL141CGACAAGCTCCATAAGGTACBAC IL142TCTGACCCAGAAACTTGATCBAC651 (with IL143)IL143GAAAGGGAGAGAGAAATCGBAC IL144GGTCTGACCTCTTATTTCCCBAC512 (with IL145)IL145AAAGCGAGGCATTCACTAGBAC IL146GCTCAAAGTGGGAATACGAGBAC475 (with IL147)IL147CTTGTGCTGCCAACTAGATGBAC IL148AAGAGCATCCAGTGACAAGBAC633 (with IL149)IL149GGATCTCCGCTTAGGTATAGBAC IL150CGCTTTCCCTATTTTGTCAGBAC576 (with IL151)IL151ACTTCACGGAGATTGATGCBAC IL152AGCCAGCAATCCTTGTTAGCBAC510 (with IL153)IL153ACCTTGAGCCAGGGAAAAGBAC IL201CTCTGGCTCGCTCATCAACCRNA1229 (with IL202)IL202AGCGTCTCATGCTCTCGTCGRNA IL203GTAAACGAGGCAGAGGCAGCRNA461 (with IL204)IL204CAGTCGGGAACTTGCAGCACRNA IL205CGGAACTCAAGGGCTACACGRNA600 (with IL206)IL206CGAACAGCTCCTTGGTCTCCRNA IL207AAATCTCTGGCTCGCTCATCRNA1389 (with IL208)IL208AGCACAAAGGAGTCACAAGGRNA IL209ACTAGGAGGAAGCATGAGACRNA1305 (with IL210)IL210CAATACAGAGTTGCGACACCRNA \n              PCR amplification and sequencing of the Ga-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein in barley\n                Oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the Ga-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein are listed in Table 2. PCR amplification from genomic DNA and sequencing of PCR products was done at LGC Genomics GmbH (Berlin, Germany) in the case of all brh1 original mutant lines, near-isogenic lines and the respective mother cultivars. In the case of ari-m mutant lines and their respective mother cultivars, isolation of genomic DNA and PCR amplification was done using the REDExtract-N-Amp™ Plant PCR Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), and sequencing of PCR products was done at StarSEQ (Mainz, Germany).\n                RNA was isolated from seedlings leaves with the help of Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). For one-step RT-PCR of RNA the SuperscriptIII one-step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) with HIFI taq enzyme was used. Sequencing of PCR products was done at StarSEQ (Mainz, Germany).\n              Allelism crosses to confirm identity of the Ari-m and the Brh1 locus in barley\n                Allelism tests were performed through crosses between BW074 (brh1.a) and BW051 (ari-m.28). Plants were grown in a greenhouse at 18°C under 16-h-light / 8-h-dark cycles. Light intensity were set to a photon flux of 300 µmol m-2 s-1. Plants were pollinated 3 days after emasculation. F1 progenies of this cross were genotyped to confirm successful crossings, and grown to maturity for phenotypic analysis to confirm allelism through visual inspection of plants.\n              ResultsIdentification of the Brh1 locus\n                The Brh1 gene is located on barley chromosome 7HS, flanked by markers CDO545 (distal) and R3139 (centromeric) [21]. The two markers are both located 0.8 cM away from the Brh1 locus. A third marker, MWG2074, was shown to co-segregate with the brh1 phenotype in the considered mapping population [21]. Due to the close proximity of the three markers to each other and Brh1, we decided to sequence their neighboring genes in all brh1 mutants in order to identify the Brh1 gene. The work was initiated before barley genomic sequence information was publically available [22]. Therefore, the marker sequences were downloaded from the NCBI probe database and used for blastn analysis of genomic databases. As a first step, sequences and genes homologous to the three barley markers of interest were identified in the genomes of rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) (Table 3). We postulated that a syntenic approach could help us to visualize barley genes in the region. However, the comparison showed that the gene content of the Brh1 target region is not fully conserved among the different grass genomes as not all markers flanking the Brh1 locus in barley could be identified in close proximity to each other in any of the rice, sorghum and brachypodium genomes (Fig. 2). The two markers CDO545 and MWG2074, which are flanking the Brh1 locus in barley, were found to be located close to each other on chromosome 1 in brachypodium. Further, six genes were present in the region of interest in all three organisms investigated (green and gray arrows in Fig. 2b). In case of five of these genes, a unigene could be identified in the barley EST database HarvEST (http://harvest.ucr.edu/). Primers were designed for these unigenes and a PCR-based screening of pooled BAC libraries was performed. We identified ten BAC clones, located in two finger-print contigs on chromosome 7H. The two finger-print contigs, 44,369 and 44,201, were both anchored to the genomic position at 12.74 cM on chromosome 7H (17). The BAC clones identified in the PCR-screen were overlapping with three sequenced BAC clones (17), providing us with a partial sequence of the Brh1 target region in barley. The six genes predicted to be located in this region could all be identified on the sequenced BACs. The three sequenced BAC clones were searched for appropriate candidate genes for the Brh1 mutation. On BAC clone HVVMRX83KHA0060C10 we could identify the Morex locus MLOC_67224.3, a sequence corresponding to the NCBI accession AF267485. This gene encodes the Ga subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein in barley. Mutations in the Ga subunit are known to be the cause of the semi-dwarf phenotype in the dwarf1 (d1) rice mutants [4], making the Ga subunit a promising candidate gene for the brh1 mutation in barley. Still, the location of the barley gene was a surprising finding. The D1 gene in rice (locus Os05g26890) is located on chromosome 5 and not in the region on chromosome 6, which was shown to be syntenic to the Brh1 region in barley [21]. Further, blastp analyses identified Sb01g045320 in sorghum and Bradi2G60350 in brachypodium as the orthologous genes of barley Brh1. Neither of the sorghum and brachypodium genes are in regions syntenic to barley.Table 3\n                        Markers in the vicinity of Brh1 [21] and the gene models associated with the best blastn hit in the genomes of rice, sorghum and brachypodium\n                      MarkerNCBI accession no.Rice blast hitSorghum blast hitBrachypodium blast hitCDO545AA231869.1AA231713.1Os06g02550.2Sb10g001310Bradi1g50590.1MWG2074AJ234755.1AJ234754.1no hit on chromosome 6no hit on chromosome 10Bradi1g50650.1Bradi1g50660.1R3139AU082160D25093Os06g03560Sb10g001530(with D25093)no conclusive hit\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        The Brh1 genomic region in barley and the syntenic regions in rice, sorghum and brachypodium. a. Brh1 has been mapped between markers CDO545 (green, NCBI accession numbers AA231869.1 and AA231713.1) and BDC129 (yellow), R3139 (blue, AU082160, D25093) and MWG2074 (red, AJ234754.1, AJ234755.1) [21]. MWG2074 was shown to have two loci, the B locus (middle, red) was co-segregating with Brh1. Marker sequences were used to identify matching loci in rice, sorghum and brachypodium (color codes kept). No obvious hits to orthologous sequences could be found for marker MWG2074 in rice and sorghum, or for R3139 in brachypodium. b. Gene content of the Brh1 syntenic region in brachypodium as identified in Fig. 2a. The loci (Bradi1g50590 and Bradi1g50660) matching markers CDO545 and MWG2074 are highlighted green and red, respectively. The genes flanked by loci Bradi1g50590 and Bradi1g50660 are found in the same order in rice and sorghum. The orthologous barley genes were used to screen pooled BAC libraries\n                      \n              \n                           Brh1 encodes the Ga subunit in barley\n                Mutations in the gene encoding the Ga subunit in rice cause the d1 mutant phenotype, a semi-dwarf phenotype similar to the brh1 phenotype in barley. Rice d1 mutants are characterized by reduced plant height, shorter panicles, and shorter, globe-shaped seeds [4]. The barley brh1 mutation also causes height reduction, changes in the spike architecture and is characterized by a rounded seed shape (Fig. 1). The matching rice phenotype and the localization of the Ga gene in the brh1 target region made the gene encoding the Ga subunit an obvious candidate gene for the brh1 mutation. Therefore, we sequenced the gene in the brh1 near-isogenic lines and in the cultivar Bowman. In each of the eight near-isogenic lines, but not in Bowman, a mutation was found with strong postulated impact on the resulting protein (Fig. 3, Table 4). In BW076 (brh1.ae) only two of the nine PCR fragments that were generated for sequencing of the Brh1 gene could be amplified from genomic DNA suggesting a partial deletion of the gene in this mutant line. Small deletions of 1 or 2 bp caused frame shifts in BW047 (ari-i.38), BW075 (brh1.aa), BW077 (brh1.e), BW078 (brh1.t) and BW080 (brh1.z). The frame shifts introduced premature stop codons in all lines except BW074 (brh1.a) where a new stop codon was introduced in the 3' untranslated region after a frame shift, thus extending exon 13. In BW079 (brh1.x) a point mutation introduced a premature stop deleting the last 20 amino acids of the protein.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Distribution of mutations identified in the gene of the Ga subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein in brh1, ari-i and ari-m barley mutants.

Two measurements per sample were performed. Standard deviations are indicated in the figure. The averages of the activities of the double-haploid lines were compared to the average of the activities of BW074, Bowman and Quench in a t-test, which revealed significant differences in enzyme activities for ß-amylase and free limit dextrinase (p < 0.05)\n                      \n                We also sequenced the gene encoding the Ga subunit from the original mutants and two additional lines, brh1.c and brh1.f, for which no near-isogenic lines have been generated (Fig. 3, Table 4). All mutations were verified and they were not present in the respective mother cultivar (Table 1). Mutation brh1.c was based on a 2 bp deletion and identical to brh1.a. Mutation brh1.f was based on a 4 bp deletion in exon 6 leading to a premature stop. We noticed several SNPs between Bowman and the mother cultivars (Bonus, Himalaya, Steptoe, Moravian, Aramir, Domen, Akashinriki and Volla) with the exception of Aapo, which was identical to Bowman over the sequenced region (Additional file 1 Table S1). We noted that the SNP pattern in mutant brh1.c was not the same as its mother cultivar Moravian. Instead they were identical to those of brh1.a and Himalaya. Still mature plants of the mutant lines brh1.c and brh1.a show different morphological characters – brh1.c is two-rowed, while brh1.a is six-rowed. We therefore suggest that the brh1 mutation was introduced into Moravian by crossing to a brh1.a mutant line instead of an independent mutational event.\n              Identification of additional brh1 alleles\n                When propagating various near-isogenic lines, we noticed that BW051 (ari-m.28) has a brh1-like phenotype with overall reduction in height and characteristic short awns. In addition, the introgression residing from the original mutant donor ari-m.28 in BW051 is reduced to a minor genetic element in the telomeric region of chromosome 7HS overlapping with the introgression regions of all brh1 Bowman near-isogenic lines (Table 1, Table 5). When sequencing the gene encoding the Ga subunit in BW051 we found a single nucleotide substitution in exon 10 leading to a premature stop codon (Fig. 3, Table 4). The same mutation was found in the original mutant line ari-m.28, which was isolated in the cultivar Bonus [20]. We also performed a cross between BW074 (brh1.a) and BW051 (ari-m.28). The F1 plants displayed a semi-dwarf and short-awn mutant phenotype, which further proves that ari-m.28 and brh1.a are allelic (Fig. 4).Table 5\n                        Summary of breviaristatum-m (ari-m) alleles, their genetic backgrounds, their availability as Bowman near-isogenic lines, and introgression regions on chromosome 7H\n                      AlleleGenetic backgroundBowman near-isogenic lineIntrogression region on 7HS (cM)\n                              ari-m.12\n                              a\n                              Bonusno line available-\n                              ari-m.28\n                              a\n                              BonusBW051a4.74 – 9.55\n                              ari-m.141\n                              a\n                              Fomano line available-\n                              ari-m.177\n                              a\n                              Fomano line available-\n                              ari-m.251\n                              a\n                              Kristinano line available-\n                              ari-m.269\n                              a\n                              Kristinano line available-\n                      The near-isogenic line has been prepared previously as well as the determination of the introgression region [11]\n                      \n                                    aSource of seed material: Nordic Genetic Resource Center, Alnarp, Sweden\n                    \n                In addition to ari-m.28, five other ari-m alleles are available (Table 5) (www.nordgen.org/bgs). A mutation in the gene encoding the Ga subunit could be identified in each of them (Fig. 3, Table 4). The mutations found in ari-m.12 and ari-m.28 are identical nucleotide substitutions introducing stop codons in exon 10. Mutant line ari-m.177 was identical to ari-i.38 (BW047), affecting a splice site between intron 8 and exon 9. Line ari-m.141 also showed a mutation in a splice site – between intron 1 and exon 2. Mutation ari-m.269 is a nucleotide substitution introducing a stop codons in exon 12. Finally, ari-m.251 is a large deletion since no parts of the Brh1 locus could be amplified by PCR.\n              Transfer of the brh1 mutation to a modern elite malting barley background\n                The available brh1 mutant alleles have been generated in several genetically different mother cultivars. In our trials, they all showed a pronounced reduction in culm length and awn length (Fig. 5). To the best of our knowledge, none of the described brh1 alleles have been tested in European breeding material. Therefore, we performed crosses between the Bowman near-isogenic line BW074 (brh1.a) and the European elite malting cultivar Quench. Double-haploid plants were generated. Two independent double-haploid lines, designated DH_A and DH_B that displayed the phenotype characteristic for brh1 mutant lines, were selected. These lines were propagated and finally tested under field conditions in two subsequent years (Fig. 6). It was observed that cultivar Bowman produced significantly lower grain yield than cultivar Quench. This was expected, as Bowman is a North American cultivar while Quench was bred for agriculture in Europe. Mutant line BW074 had a yield comparable to that of Bowman. The double-haploid lines yielded higher than Bowman and BW074 but lower than Quench. A repetition of the field trial with a reduced number of lines in the following year gave similar results (Fig. 6b). We conclude that the yield of brh1 mutant lines can be significantly increased by backcrossing to a modern elite line.\n              The effect of the brh1 mutation on malting quality\n                The brh1 double-haploid lines generated in this study were tested in laboratory scale micro malting experiments together with the near-isogenic line BW074 (brh1.a) and the cultivars Quench and Bowman. We measured the activity of three key starch degrading enzymes a-amylase, ß-amylase and free limit dextrinase (Fig. 7). The brh1 double-haploid lines showed an increase in activity, especially for ß-amylase and free limit dextrinase activity. The reason for this observation remains elusive but can partly be caused by a changed volume-area ratio in the global shaped brh1 seeds. Still, the presented results do not indicate that the brh1 mutation has a negative effect on malting quality in barley.\n              DiscussionWhile there are several genes encoding Ga, Gß and G<U+03B3> subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins in mammals, there is only one Ga, one Gß and three G<U+03B3> encoding genes in arabidopsis, and one Ga, one Gß and four G<U+03B3> genes in rice [29]. Analysis of the recently sequenced barley genome [22, 17]) reveals one Ga (gene identity in Mascher et al. [22] HORVU7Hr1G008720.11), one Gß (HORVU4Hr1G003110.4) and four G<U+03B3> genes (HORVU5Hr1G093530.3, HORVU5Hr1G093550.1, AK367089, HORVU5Hr1G061840.7). In mammalian systems, binding of a ligand to the G-protein-coupled receptor causes a rapid exchange of GDP to GTP bound by the Ga-subunit, which promotes a dissociation of activated Ga-GTP from the Gß<U+03B3> heterodimer [32]. Activated Ga-GTP and/or Gß<U+03B3> interacts with effector proteins. A different system for G-protein signaling is found in plants. The arabidopsis Ga subunit spontaneously binds GTP in vitro [19] but its ability to stimulate effector molecules is inhibited by its association to a membrane bound Regulator-of-G-protein-signaling (RGS) protein [34]. Upon binding of a ligand to the RGS protein, the Ga-GTP subunit is released and can interact with effector molecules.In the present study we demonstrated that barley Brh1 is orthologous to rice D1 encoding a Ga-subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein [4]. In addition, we characterized nine brh1, one ari-i and six ari-m mutants at the DNA level, and demonstrate that Ari-m is allelic to Brh1. It has previously been reported that Brh1 and Ari-i are allelic [33]. All sixteen mutations result in severe changes of the Brh1 gene and gene product – deletions, nonsense mutations or frame shifts leading to modified polypeptides. It was recently shown that the barley Ari-e encodes a G<U+03B3> subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein [18, 35], being orthologous to DEP1 in rice [16]. Further, the gene product of TUD1 in rice, a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been suggested to directly interact with the rice Ga subunit and is therefore directly responsible for the turnover of heterotrimeric G proteins [15]. We found recently that barley Brh2 is orthologous to TUD1 in rice (Braumann et al. unpublished). Barley brh1, brh2 and ari-e mutants have short-culm phenotypes, which is now understood in the light of their connection to the heterotrimeric G protein.Although genes encoding subunits of the heterotrimeric G protein complex now start to be identified, it is still not clear in which signaling pathway the complex is participating. The response to both brassinosteroids and gibberellic acids have been investigated for brh1 mutants in previous studies. In contrast to uzu mutants, brh1 mutants are brassinosteroid sensitive [14], making it unlikely that brh1 is part of the brassinosteroid signaling pathway. It has further been shown that application of gibberellic acid leads to increased elongation of brh1 plants in a similar extend as for wild type plants. Still, both gibberellic acid treated and untreated brh1 plants are significantly shorter than wild type plants that had received the same treatment [5]. These findings disprove the direct involvement of the Brh1 gene in either gibberellic acid signaling or biosynthesis.Dahleen et al. [8] did a detailed study of the agronomic performance of five recessive brh1 lines – BW047 (ari-i.38), BW074 (brh1.a), BW078 (brh1.t), BW080 (brh1.z) and BW075 (brh1.aa). The parameters including plant height, lodging, yield, number of kernels per spike and kernel weight. All brh1 plants were shown to be significantly shorter and more lodging resistant than the cultivar Bowman. The mutants displayed a lower kernel weight but otherwise yields were like Bowman with the exception of BW075 (bri1.aa), which yielded lower. Based on their results it was concluded that the brh1 mutations introduce agronomically valuable traits like shorter plant stature and lower lodging potential while negative effects of the mutation on agronomical key traits like yield seem to be neglectable [8]. Our study indicated a lower yield due to the brh1 mutation but we assume that recurrent backcrossing to Quench would increase the yield like it did in the Bowman near-isogenic lines studied by Dahleen et al. [8]. More important, our results showed no negative effect on malting qualities due to the brh1 mutation. We therefore suggest that Brh1 might be a competitive breeding alternative to other used semi-dwarfing genes like Ari-e, Ert-k, Sdw1, Sdw4 and Uzu1.ConclusionsMutants in the Brh1 locus are deficient in the Ga subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein, which shows that heterotrimeric G proteins are important regulators of culm length in barley. It is still not clear in which signaling pathway the complex is participating. Sixteen mutant alleles were characterized at DNA level and display a repertoire of deletions and nucleotide substitutions. While our study suggests a lower yield due to mutations in Brh1, we did not see any negative effects on malting quality. Thus, brh1 mutant alleles might be used in order to breed for robust and lodging resistant malting barley cultivars.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThis study was supported by the Carlsberg Foundation, Grønt Udviklings- og Demonstrations Program (GUDP, Denmark, 34009-12-0522), Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany, DO1482/1-1), the Crafoord Foundation (20150748) and the CF Lundström Foundation.\n                Funding\n                This study was supported by the Carlsberg Foundation, Grønt Udviklings- og Demonstrations Program (GUDP, Denmark, 34,009-12-0522), Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Germany, DO1482/1-1), the Crafoord Foundation (20150748) and the CF Lundström Foundation.\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                Not applicable.\n              Authors’ contributionsIB, CD, SB, AH, FL, UL, SZ and RZ performed experiments.

In the search for new molecular targeted therapy medicines, and recurrence of early-warning indicators have become the major focus of contemporary research, because they improve diagnostic accuracy. Biomarkers reflect the physiological, physical and biochemical status of the body, and so have extensive applicability and practical significance. The ascertainment of schizophrenia biomarkers will help diagnose, stratify of disease, and treat of schizophrenia patients. The detection of biomarkers from blood has become a promising area of schizophrenia research. Recently, a series of studies revealed that, MiRNAs play an important role in the genesis of schizophrenia, and their abnormal expressions have the potential to be used as biomarkers of schizophrenia. This article presents and summarizes the value of peripheral blood miRNAs with abnormal expression as the biomarker of schizophrenia.KeywordsSchizophreniaBiomarkersPeripheral MiRNAsSignificance and valuesBackgroundSchizophrenia is a kind of brain dysfunction that can induce cognitive, emotional, mental and behavioral disorders. It affects about 1 ~ 1.5% of the world population [1]. Research findings showed that genetic factors were the main causes of schizophrenia and the heritability of schizophrenia can be as high as 80% [2]. It often occurs in young adults with symptoms so subtle that is difficult to identify and diagnose. The psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia specified in the latest [5th] edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is based on symptoms rather than on pathophysiological and biochemical indicators [3]. The main symptoms of schizophrenia can be seen in Table 1. At present, the diagnoses of all mental disorders are based on signs and symptoms, rather than on pathophysiological and biochemical indicators [3]. Psychiatry has thus become one branch of medicine which does not rely on laboratory tests [4].Table 1\n                      The main symptoms of schizophrenia\n                    Main symptonsExplainationDelusionsThese are false beliefs that are not based in realityHallucinationsSeeing or hearing things that aren’t there.Disorganized thinkingUsing words and sentences that don’t make sense to others.Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behaviorActing in an odd or repetitive way, like walking in circles or writing all the time, or sitting perfectly still and quiet for hours on end.Negative symptomsThis refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally.Biomarkers are substances that can reflect the physiological and biochemical status of an organism. They serve as indicators for pharmacological response in a normal biological process, case procedure or therapeutic intervention. The blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, autopsy specimens and tissue samples of schizophrenia patients provide rich gene and protein expressions under physiological and pathological conditions. A comprehensive analysis of these expressions is helpful in the identification of the biomarkers and in the determination of the therapeutic intervention measures and drug targets in the early diagnosis of the disease [5]. The detection of schizophrenia biomarkers aids prediction of the occurrence of the disease, accurate diagnosis, prognosis and treatment [6].MiRNAs and schizophreniaThe etiology of schizophrenia is so complex that its causes are not yet fully understood. Both genetic and environmental factors are involved in the occurrence of schizophrenia [7, 8]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, endogenous and noncoding single-stranded RNAs, 22–25 nucleotides in length, which participate in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. MiRNAs are estimated to regulate the translation of up to 60% of protein-coding genes [9]. Due to the differential target binding patterns, as many as 200 target genes may be regulated by a single miRNA [10]. It has been found that miRNAs were commonly present in a variety of organisms and are involved in almost all life processes, including development, differentiation, growth regulation and apoptosis [11].It was confirmed that about 70% of human miRNAs express in the nervous system [12] and so are variously involved in the regulation of neural structure and function. For example, they play a role in the formation of dendrites and dendritic spines in axon growth as well as in neural developments and the maturation process [13]. Studies have demonstrated that they are also involved in the occurrence of neuropsychiatric disorders, and that their abnormal expressions could be treated as potential biomarkers [14, 15]. Miller et al. [14] (2010) and Sun [15] (2015) held the view that changes of miRNA expressions played a role in the genetic and biological mechanisms of neuropsychiatric diseases.Epidemiological evidence suggests the etiology of schizophrenia may involve both genetic and environment factors. Thus, the environmental contribution to schizophrenia progression is through epigenetic mechanisms [16]. The study of mental illness from the perspective of epigenetics therefore informs and illuminates its pathogenesis. In the biological pathways of miRNA, the variation of miRNA target genes may also play a role in the occurrence of primarily schizophrenia. Beveridge et al. [17] (2012) considered that miRNAs influenced the occurrence of schizophrenia via the development of the central nervous system, gene expression regulation and other mechanisms. Since miRNAs are extensively regulated by transcription and are sensitive to changes in the biological pathway, miRNA abnormalities or mutations in cell may lead to neurological disorders including the pathophysiological changes of schizophrenia. Guo et al. [18] (2010) confirmed that miR-195 was involved in a complex regulatory network by which the signaling pathways of the occurrence of schizophrenia were affected. The gene encoding miR-346 was located at the intron glutamate receptors ionic d1 gene (GRID1), and the GRID1 gene is the susceptibility gene for schizophrenia [19]. MiR-30a-5p and miR-195 may regulate the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), so it is suggested that miR-195 may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia by regulating BDNF [20].GWAS studies verify that rs1625579 located within miR-137 genes (1p21.3) was significantly associated with schizophrenia (P = 1.6 × 10-11) [21]. The regulation target genes of miR-137 are CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 gene (CSMD1), WW domain binding protein 1 like gene (C10orf26), calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C gene (CACNA1C), transcription factor 4 gene (TCF4) and zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A), and these genes were confirmed to be genetic risk genes for schizophrenia [22–25].Through bioinformatics and functional test methods, Valles et al. [26] (2014) confirmed again that five target genes that miR-137 regulated, including CACNA1C, TCF4 and ZNF804A, belong to the glucocorticoid receptor-dependent signal transduction network. CACNA1C gene in particularly has been repeatedly shown to be genetic susceptibility genes for schizophrenia in different types of population [21, 22, 27, 28].MiRNAs from peripheral blood as potential biomarkers for schizophreniaMany miRNAs are specifically expressed in cells or tissues, and their expression levels are also related to the pathological or physiological processes of the corresponding cells or tissues. Abnormal expression of miRNAs reflects the pathological state of the organism. Studies have found that the expression profiles of some miRNAs were significant different between the patient and the normal. Differentially expressed miRNAs are likely to be a noninvasive and accurate new biomarker for the diagnosis of disease. Although the etiology of schizophrenia is not certain, abnormal expressions of miRNAs are detected in brain tissues and peripheral blood on the part of schizophrenia patients. As biomarkers of tumors, miRNAs have been shown to be beneficial in clinical stratification, and to have even greater predictive value compared with mRNA [17]. The abnormally expressed miRNAs have been recently isolated from brain tissue [29–31], whole blood [32, 33], serum [34], plasma [35, 36] and PBMC [37], and recognized as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The difficulties of conducting brain biopsies have consequences for obtaining abnormally expressed miRNAs for the purpose of prediction and diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder [38]. Since the expression profiles of miRNAs that are present in peripheral blood change with the changes of the body’s physiological and pathological conditions [39], they have important clinical applications. Research investigating biomarkers of schizophrenia in peripheral blood is increasing. Particularly, more and more molecular detection techniques with high specificity and sensitivity are applied in the search for serum markers or genetic markers in peripheral blood.Abnormally expressed miRNA has also been detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the plasma of the patients with schizophrenia. Gardiner et al. [37] (2011) analyzed miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 112 psychiatric patients and 76 non-psychotic patients under symptom control. They found that the 83 miRNAs expression in the 112 psychiatric patients was significantly lower than that of the non-psychotic group. 17 down-regulated miRNAs were from the imprinting area, DLK-DIO3 region of 14q32, which is closely associated with schizophrenia. Using qRT-PCR, 7 miRNAs (miR-31, miR-431, miR-433, miR-107, miR-134, miR-99b and miR-487b) were confirmed again to down-regulate.Using microarray, Lai et al. [40] (2011) compared 30 schizophrenia patients with 30 controls and discovered differences in the miRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. Logistic regression analysis of the expression differences in the 7 miRNAs (hsa-miR-34a, miR-449a, miR-564, miR-432, miR-548d, miR-572 and miR-652), revealed emotional retardation, language poverty and other neurocognitive dysfunction-associated symptoms. Shi et al. [34] (2012) found that miR-181b, miR-219-2-3p, miR-1308 and let-7 g in serum were up-regulated, while miRNA-195 was down-regulated. De la Morena et al. [32] (2013) investigated the miRNA expressions in the peripheral blood of patients with 22q11.2DS (22q11 micro-deletion syndrome), and found that 18 miRNAs were differently expressed, and that the miR-185 in the neurons of 90% to 95% of the 22q11.2DS patients was down-regulated.By using real-time quantitative PCR, Sun et al. [35] (2014) analyzed the expression profiles of nine schizophrenia-related miRNAs in peripheral blood plasma and mononuclear cells, and confirmed that miRNA30e specificity in plasma could be used as a biomarker for diagnosis of schizophrenia. Wei et al. [41] (2015) demonstrated by using high throughput sequencing and RT- qPCR assays that miR-130b and miR-193a-3p serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Using qPCR, Sun et al. [36] (2015) analyzed the expression profiles of 10 miRNAs in plasma from 61 patients with schizophrenia, 62 normal controls, and 25 patients taking antipsychotic drugs for 6 weeks. It was found that miR-30e, MiR-181b, miR-34a, miR-346 and miR-7 as a whole can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic marker for schizophrenia, and that miR-132, miR-181b, miR-30e and miR-432 can all be used as indicators of schizophrenia symptom improvement, drug efficacy and prognosis.Using qPCR, Lai et al. [33] (2016) analyzed the expressions of 7 miRNAs (hsa-miR-34a, miR-449a, miR-564, miR-432, miR-548d, miR-572, miR-542 and MiR-652) that had previously been identified as potential biomarkers for schizophrenia in acute disease. After 2 months of hospitalization and symptomatic relief, the expressions of the 7 miRNAs in peripheral blood of patients did not change and that their expressions in peripheral blood were stable as schizophrenia diagnostic biomarkers. Using RT-qPCR technology, Liu et al. [42] (2017), suggested that the EGR1-miR-30a-5p-NEUROD1 axis might serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and treatment monitoring for patients in an acute psychotic state.The above tests confirm that miRNA profiling in peripheral blood can be used to determine biomarkers for schizophrenia and related subtypes of mental illness. MiRNAs of peripheral blood that can be biomarkers of schizophrenia can be seen in Table 2. It may help to elucidate the etiology of schizophrenia with ambiguous clinical symptoms and identifies potential differences between psychiatric disorders with similar, easily confusable symptoms [43].Table 2\n                      The list of miRNAs of peripheral blood that can be used as biomarkers of schizophrenia\n                    MiRNABiological functionalityDirection associated with schizophreniaAs BiomarkersAuthor (Refs.)miRNA30eMitosis, cell division, etcup-regulationhsa-miRNA30eSun et al.

[42] (2017)ConclusionsProgress in the foregoing highlights the potential significance of miRNA as a diagnostic marker of schizophrenia. MiRNA expression profiles from peripheral blood not only are potential schizophrenia biomarkers but also have association with schizophrenia subtypes. The study of miRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood is of far reaching significance because it provides the basis for the early detection of schizophrenia, disease stratification and the prediction of drug response and side effects. It enables further study of the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, their relationship with the disease, their proteins expression profiles, and the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and it will lead to the elucidation of the complex etiology of schizophrenia. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of the occurrence and development of schizophrenia, its specificity, especially of the early warning and diagnostic biomarkers obtained directly from the blood, have been an important and urgent priority in schizophrenia research. Ongoing improvements in the detection, assessment and intervention strategies for miRNA are promoting the development of the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia, and facilitating miRNA applications in other disease diagnoses and treatments.Abbreviations\n                22q11DS: \n                    22q11 micro-deletion syndrome\n                  \n                    BDNF\n                  : \n                    Brain-derived neurotrophic factors\n                  \n                    C10orf26\n                  : \n                    WW domain binding protein 1 like gene\n                  \n                    CACNA1C\n                  : \n                    Calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C gene\n                  \n                    CSMD1\n                  : \n                    CUB and sushi multiple domains 1 gene\n                  DSM: \n                    The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders\n                  \n                    GRID1\n                  : \n                    Intron glutamate receptors ionic d1 gene\n                  MiRNAs: \n                    MicroRNAs\n                  \n                    TCF4\n                  : \n                    Transcription factor 4\n                  \n                    ZNF804A\n                  : \n                    Gene and zinc finger protein 804A\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe are deeply grateful to Eric Smithson of Ningbo University for the revision and correction of the paper.\n                Funding\n                This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundations of China (No 81501151, No 81660234), the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia (No 2015BS0808), the Doctor Scientific Research Foundation of Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities (No BS331), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2015CB559100), the Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader (15XD1502200), National Program for Support of Top-Notch Young Professionals, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Psychotic Disorders (13dz2260500), and Inner Mongolia Science and Technology Plan (20130612).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                Data sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\n              Authors’ contributionsKH, CG, YS and HL conceived the study and wrote the manuscript.

Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy] is one of the most widely used grasses on golf courses, with cultivars derived from ‘Tifgreen’ or ‘Tifdwarf’ particularly used for putting greens. Many bermudagrass cultivars established for putting greens can be genetically unstable and lead to the occurrence of undesirable off-type grasses that vary in phenotype. The objective of this research was to genetically and phenotypically differentiate off-type grasses and hybrid cultivars. Beginning in 2013, off-type and desirable hybrid bermudagrass samples were collected from golf course putting greens in the southeastern United States and genetically and phenotypically characterized using genotyping-by-sequencing and morphology.\n              \n                Results\n                Genotyping-by-sequencing determined that 11% (5) of off-type and desirable samples from putting greens were genetically divergent from standard cultivars such as Champion, MiniVerde, Tifdwarf, TifEagle, and Tifgreen. In addition, genotyping-by-sequencing was unable to genetically distinguish all standard cultivars from one another due to their similar origin and clonal propagation; however, over 90,000 potentially informative nucleotide variants were identified among the triploid hybrid cultivars.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Although few genetic differences were found in this research, samples harvested from golf course putting greens had variable morphology and were clustered into three distinct phenotypic groups. The majority of off-type grasses in hybrid bermudagrass putting greens were genetically similar with variable morphological traits. Off-type grasses within golf course putting greens have the potential to compromise putting surface functionality and aesthetics.\n              KeywordsTurfgrassBermudagrassOff-typesGenotyping-by-sequencingMorphologyPutting greensBackgroundThe economic impact of the golf industry in the United States (U.S.) in 2011 was estimated to be $176.8 billion with a contribution of approximately 1.98 million jobs (SRI International; http://wearegolf.org/economy/impact). Interspecific hybrid bermudagrasses (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) are some of the most widely utilized grasses on golf courses throughout tropical, subtropical, and temperate climates due to their desirable turfgrass characteristics of texture, color, and stress tolerance [2]. Putting greens are a vital aspect of a golf course and in 2007 hybrid bermudagrasses were grown on 80% of putting green acreage in the southern U.S. [29].‘Tifgreen’ was one of the first interspecific hybrids developed for putting green use [6, 21]. Soon after its commercial release, ‘Tifdwarf’ was selected from a somatic mutation in a ‘Tifgreen’ establishment [7, 8]. Despite being genetically unstable [9, 10], ‘Tifgreen’ and ‘Tifdwarf’ are used on putting surfaces; however, superior mutations have been released as new “ultradwarf” cultivars [36]. Ultradwarf bermudagrass cultivars are classified due to their more diminutive morphology (i.e., internode length and leaf length and width) compared to ‘Tifdwarf’. ‘Champion’ and ‘MiniVerde’ were selected from somatic mutations in established ‘Tifdwarf’ plantings [5, 23], whereas ‘TifEagle’ was a putative mutant from radiation-induced ‘Tifgreen’ or ‘Tifway II’ rhizome [18, 20, 41]. In all cases, “ultradwarf” cultivars such as ‘Champion’, ‘MiniVerde’, and ‘TifEagle’ were once identified as off-types.Morphological characterization has been considered a traditional method of studying turfgrass classification and diversity [3, 22, 25, 38]. Morphological characteristics such as internode length, leaf length, leaf width, and stolon diameter are of particular interest for classification of bermudagrasses [25, 26, 38] because differences in morphology can differentiate off-types from desirable cultivars [9, 10]. Additionally, Roche and Loch [37] stated that morphological characterization could provide useful information to further research for adaptation and management of different hybrid bermudagrasses. Researchers have used morphological characterizations to compare hybrid bermudagrass cultivars within the ‘Tifgreen’ family [31, 37]; however, morphological inconsistencies suggest that molecular techniques are also needed to accurately evaluate hybrid bermudagrass diversity [36].Several methods have been used to explore genotypic differences among off-type grasses and hybrid bermudagrass cultivars. DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF) and signatures from amplification profiles identified contaminant off-types not related to the ‘Tifgreen’ family, but could not distinguish mutant off-types within the ‘Tifgreen’ family [9]. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) studies determined the genetic diversity among several ‘Tifgreen’-derived cultivars. Studies utilizing AFLPs grouped ‘Tifgreen’, ‘Tifdwarf’, ‘TifEagle’, and ‘Champion’ into the same genetic cluster despite the grasses having differing phenotypic characteristics [11, 12, 41]. Attempts to use various simple-sequence repeats (SSRs) to identify ‘Tifgreen’-derived hybrid bermudagrass cultivars met with limited success as well [19, 24]. While SSRs identified ‘TifEagle’ from other ‘Tifgreen’-derived cultivars and identified polymorphisms unique to ‘Tifdwarf’ and ‘MiniVerde’ [19, 24], SSRs are not able to readily distinguish all ‘Tifgreen’-derived hybrid bermudagrass cultivars from one another nor have they been able to identify weedy off-type grasses from standard cultivars used on golf course putting greens. Fig. 1 displays the aesthetic and functional disruptions that off-type grasses in bermudagrass putting greens can create.\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      \n                                    a Off-type grasses (lighter in color and noted by red circle) present in an ultradwarf bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.)

The difference in growth rate between the desirable and off-type grasses has the potential to disrupt the functional uniformity of putting surfaces with off-type infestations. Figure was generated using Keynote (v6.6.2)\n                    Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a high-throughput, next generation sequencing method capable of generating large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from species with high diversity [13]. GBS offers several advantages over other molecular marker techniques including the amount data generated and the price per sample [13, 15]. Moreover, GBS allows analysis of a species (e.g., hybrid bermudagrass) for which a complete reference genome sequence is not available. Fiedler et al. [15] identified over 4600 high-quality SNPs in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) using an early draft genome assembly with only half of the assembled DNA contigs scaffolded. Poland et al. [32] used GBS to map over 34,000 SNPs for the Oregon Wolfe Barley (Hordeum vulgare) reference population and 20,000 SNPs for the Synthetic W9784xOpata85 wheat (Triticum aestivum) reference population, both of which lacked a complete reference genome sequence. Based on the robustness of the technique and successful use in other grasses without a complete reference genome [13, 15, 32, 33], we hypothesize that GBS may be able to identify genetic variation among off-types and hybrid bermudagrasses used on putting greens. Therefore, our objectives were to explore the genetic and the phenotypic variation among off-type grasses sampled from hybrid bermudagrass putting greens using GBS and morphological characterization.MethodsSingle replicates of desirable and off-type hybrid bermudagrass samples were harvested in 2013 from putting greens on golf courses in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee (Table 1). The greenkeeper at each golf course determined samples that were desirable from those that were off-type grasses. Samples were harvested with a 7.5 cm diameter tubular plugger (Turf Tec International; Tallahassee, FL, USA) and established using one three node stolon planted in a 64 cm2 pot filled with a peat moss based growing medium (Pro-Mix BX Mycorrhizae; Premier Horticulture, Inc.; Quakertown, PA, USA) in a glasshouse environment at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville, TN, USA; 35.5°N, -83.5°W). Plants were maintained with 24 kg N ha-1 wk.-1 of a water-soluble complete fertilizer (20 N-8.7P-16.6 K; Southern Agriculture; Hendersonville, NC, USA), irrigated to promote active growth, and insecticides (abamectin 0.01 kg ai ha-1, Avid 0.15EC, Syngenta; pymetrozine 0.35 kg ai ha-1, Endeavor, Syngenta) were applied on a preventive basis.Table 1\n                      Plant material used in genetic and phenotypic evaluation of off-type grasses in ultradwarf hybrid bermudagrass putting greens (Cynodon dactylon (L.)

Six standard (ST) hybrid bermudagrass cultivars [Champion (CH1–6), MiniVerde (MV1–6), Tifdwarf (TD1–6), TifEagle (TE1–6), Tifgreen (TG1–6), and Tifway (TW1–6)] and two progenitor species [(C. dactylon (TA1–3 and TB1–3) and C. transvaalensis (DA1–3 and DB1–3)] were included in the analysis for comparison. Ploidy level was confirmed using flow cytometry\n                    \n                                 aDesirable and off-type samples were harvested from golf course putting greens. Standard samples were provided by the University of Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station in Tifton, GA\n                    \n                                 bPloidy was confirmed using flow cytometry. Ploidy was not confirmed for samples with “NA”\n                  Ploidy levels were confirmed for each sample included in the GBS assay using flow cytometry at the University of Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station (Tifton, GA). Fresh leaf tissue was isolated from samples and chopped using a razor in 300 µL of LB01-lysis buffer (15 mM Tris, 2 mM Na2EDTA, 0.5 mM spermine-4HCl, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 pH 7.5 and 16 mM ß-mercaptoethanol) to release nuclei. Each bermudagrass sample was combined with Sorghum bicolor cv. BTx623 for a standard genome size comparison. Samples were passed through a 30-µm filter (CellTrics; Partec; Munster, Germany) and then 150 µL of RNase and propidium iodide solution (PI/RNase Staining Buffer, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was added. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min and analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA). Gating was set by the selection of objects that exhibited a strong correlation between the FL2 and FL3 signals using a flow rate of 14 µL per minute and a minimum cell count of 10,000. The mean FL2-A peaks from the signals were determined for S. bicolar and each unknown hybrid bermudagrass sample using Accuri C6 software (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA). These mean FL2-A values were then used with S. bicolar genome size (1.67 pg/2C) to calculate the genome size of each unknown hybrid bermudagrass sample [34].Genotyping-by-sequencing\n                Plant material and DNA isolation\n                  Desirable and off-type samples labeled S1 to S47 in Table 1 were included in GBS due to the expense of the analysis. Hybrid bermudagrass cultivars [Champion (CH1–6), MiniVerde (MV1–6), Tifdwarf (TD1–6), TifEagle (TE1–6), Tifgreen (TG1–6), and Tifway (TW1–6)] and progenitor species [C. dactylon (TA1–3 and TB1–3) and C. transvaalensis (DA1–3 and DB1–3)] were used as standards in the GBS analysis. Only three biological replicates of the progenitor species were included also due to the expense of the analysis. Plant material for these standard entries was obtained from the University of Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station (Tifton, GA, USA).\n                  For all samples, plant genomic DNA was isolated from actively growing leaf tissue on a single stolon using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA concentration was quantified using an intercalating dye (Quant-iT™ PicoGreen dsDNA Asasy Kit; Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA, USA). DNA working solutions for the GBS protocol had a total volume of 30 µL and a concentration ranging from 50 to 105 ng µL-1.\n                Genotyping-by-sequencing analysis\n                  Genotyping-by-sequencing was conducted at the Cornell University Institute for Biotechnology (Ithaca, NY) using the protocol described by Elshire et al. [13]. ApeKI restriction enzyme was selected based on optimization trials for the GBS digestion to maximize the number of sampled genomic loci [13]. Libraries for next-generation sequencing were constructed from DNA samples and multiplexed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 and then Illumina NextSeq 500 to increase read coverage and depth.\n                Bioinformatics analysis\n                  The combined Illumina data sets were initially analyzed with the UNEAK pipeline of the Tassel software package [4, 17]. One of the limitations of the UNEAK pipeline is that its nucleotide variant calling algorithm relies on a diploid model. Bermudagrasses sequenced in our GBS analysis included diploid (2n = 2× = 18), triploid (2n = 3× = 27), and tetraploid (2n = 4× = 36) samples; therefore, an alternative approach was used to call variants. Sequence tags with a predicted variant were extracted from the topm.bin libraries generated during the Tag-Pair-Export phase using the UNEAK Binary-to-text-plugin; then raw reads were mapped with Bowtie2 v2.2.7 to these tags generated from the UNEAK pipeline as a pseudo-reference [27].\n                  The haplotype-based variants caller, Freebayes v1.0.2–15, was used to call variants for each set of samples with the same ploidy level with the correct ploidy level specified with parameter p [16]. The sorting, indexing, and merging of alignment files was performed with the SAMtools v1.3 package [28]. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots were generated from these variants using PLINK v1.9 to illustrate the variation among samples. The bermudagrass samples S19, S28, S30, S32, and S44 were not included because they had less than one million raw-reads [35]. The individual samples for each triploid cultivar were pooled to increase the read depth for each cultivar. The read alignment files were pooled using SAMtools v1.3 package [28] and then the FreeBayes method of determining variants was utilized again. The pooled data was then used in a custom Python script to determine loci that differed between at least two cultivars (github.com/statonlab/UDBG_Informative_SNPs/blob/master/find_informative_SNPs.py). Any loci with three different genotypes (homozygous for the reference allele, homozygous for the alternate allele, or heterozygous) for at least two cultivars were flagged. Loci were not flagged if heterozygosity differed between or within the two subgenomes in triploid cultivars (i.e., 0/0/1 or 0/1/1). Lastly, each cultivar was filtered to use only individual variants with a read depth greater than or equal to 40. All raw read data has been submitted to NCBI under BioProject accession PRJNA353769.\n                Phenotypic evaluation\n                Plant materials\n                  Bermudagrass samples labeled S1 to S62, except for S13, S14, S19, S20, and S43 were used in phenotypic evaluation (Table 1). Bermudagrass samples S13, S14, S19, S20, and S43 were excluded from phenotypic evaluation due to their harvest date. The greenkeeper at each golf course determined samples that were desirable from those that were off-type grasses. Samples were harvested with a 7.5 cm diameter tubular plugger (Turf Tec International; Tallahassee, FL, USA) and established during the summer of 2013 using one three node stolon planted in a 64 cm2 pot filled with a peat moss based growing medium (Pro-Mix BX Mycorrhizae; Premier Horticulture, Inc.; Quakertown, PA, USA) in a glasshouse environment at the University of Tennessee (Knoxville, TN, USA; 35.5°N, -83.5°W). Plants were maintained with 24 kg N ha-1 wk.-1 of a water-soluble complete fertilizer (20 N-8.7P-16.6 K; Southern Agriculture; Hendersonville, NC, USA), irrigated to promote active growth, and insecticides (abamectin 0.01 kg ai ha-1, Avid 0.15EC, Syngenta; pymetrozine 0.35 kg ai ha-1, Endeavor, Syngenta) were applied on a preventive basis.\n                  For phenotypic evaluation, one three-node stolon of each sample was established in four, 64 cm2 pots filled with a peat moss based growing medium (Pro-Mix BX Mycorrhizae; Premier Horticulture, Inc.; Quakertown, PA, USA) on 7 April 2014. The stolon length at transplanting of the 52 selections ranged from 3.4 to 11.3 cm. The plants were maintained as previously described but regular clipping was ceased 2 weeks prior to evaluation.\n                Morphological measurements and statistical analysis\n                  Phenotypic evaluation of off-type and desirable samples was conducted by measuring plant morphological characteristics via methods outlined by Roche and Loch [37]. Five parameters were assessed and included internode length and stolon diameter, leaf length and width, and the leaf length:width ratio (LWR). Measurements were made between the third and fourth node and on the outer leaf from the third node using digital calipers (Digimatic Caliper, Model No.CD-6<U+2033> CX, Mitutoyo Corporation, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa, Japan). The experiment was a completely randomized design with pots replicated four times and morphology measured on three stolons per pot. Morphology was assessed on 3 June 2014 and repeated again on 25 June 2014.\n                  All morphological data describing desirable and off-type hybrid bermudagrass samples were analyzed using cluster analysis in SAS Enterprise Guide (Version 6.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). K-means clustering algorithm was used to partition the data set into a user-defined number of clusters [30]. Three clusters were determined based on the cubic clustering criterion and the frequency of observations in each cluster [30]. Cluster means and standard deviations for each morphological measurement were then graphed in Prism (Prism 6 for Mac OS X; GraphPad Software, Inc.) to determine statistical differences among cluster means.\n                ResultsGenotyping-by-sequencing\n                Over 878 million reads were generated through Illumina sequencing, with 271 million from the Illumina HiSeq platform and an additional 606 million from the same libraries run on the Illumina NextSeq platform. Of the 878 million reads, 757 million were determined to be of high quality and were able to be demultiplexed and assigned to individual plant samples. After excluding five samples with less than a million reads, the remaining individual samples had a range of 1.3 (sample S44) million reads to 13.9 million reads (sample S22). The variants yielded from GBS analysis include single nucleotide variants, multiple nucleotide variants, and indels. An initial 1,088,920 total variants were identified with an average read depth of 4.9 sequences for the triploid bermudagrass (C. dactylon x C. transvaalensis) samples. GBS analysis identified 347,512 total variants with an average read depth of 9.5 per individual for the two diploid, C. transvaalensis selections. For the tetraploid, C. dactylon samples, 587,053 total variants were identified with an average sequence read depth of 7.4 (Fig. 2). Only 136,205 variants were shared among diploid, triploid, and tetraploid species; therefore, the remaining variants are fixed in at least one species (Fig. 2).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Venn diagram showing the number of total and shared nucleotide variants from GBS for Cynodon transvaalensis, C. dactylon, and C. dactylon x C. transvaalensis. Ploidy levels were confirmed using flow cytometry and are noted in parentheses. Figure was generated using Keynote (v.6.6.2)\n                      \n                The majority of samples harvested from golf courses clustered with the hybrid bermudagrass cultivars Champion, MiniVerde, Tifdwarf, TifEagle, and Tifgreen in the MDS plot (Fig. 3). The clustering suggested that samples from golf courses were genetically similar to those hybrid bermudagrass cultivars typically established on golf course putting greens (Fig. 3). Of the 47 unknown samples, only five (~11%) were genetically divergent from the standard cultivars (S4, S16, S31, S33, and S45), as illustrated by the MDS plot (Fig. 3). Hybrid bermudagrass cultivars Champion, MiniVerde, Tifdwarf, TifEagle, and Tifgreen were genetically similar to one another; however, GBS separated these cultivars from ‘Tifway’ hybrid bermudagrass (Fig. 3). Pooling individual cultivar samples yielded a higher average read depth of 31 per variant site per cultivar. Using the pooled data, 675,578 loci were identified as different between at least two cultivars. The majority of these genotype differences were only able to differentiate cultivars within the ‘Tifgreen’-cultivar family from those with different lineage (i.e., ‘Tifway’) (Table 2). Table 2 exhibits the number of nucleotide variants with different genotypes between each pair of triploid hybrid bermudagrass cultivars. Variants were included if they were homozygous for the reference allele in one cultivar and homozygous for the alternate allele in the other cultivar or if they were homozygous in one cultivar and heterozygous in the other. ‘Tifway’ has a much larger number of variants compared to the other five cultivars (29,614 variants when compared to ‘MiniVerde’ to 37,802 when compared to ‘Tifdwarf’). The five other cultivars are more similar to each other, with the highest number of identified variants of 4476 between ‘Tifdwarf’ and ‘Tifgreen’.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        \n                                       a Multidimensional scaling plot (MDS) of nucleotide variants from 47 desirable and off-type bermudagrasses sampled from golf course putting greens (S1–47), six hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) cultivars [Champion (CH1–6), MiniVerde (MV1–6), Tifdwarf (TD1–6), TifEagle (TE1–6), Tifgreen (TG1–6), and Tifway (TW1–6)], and two progenitor species [C. dactylon (TA1–3, TB1–3) and C. transvaalensis (DA1–3, DB1–3)]. Samples S19, S28, S30, S32, and S44 were not included due to lack of read depth. Variants were generated using Freebayes, the MDS plot was calculated in Plink, and plotted in R. The asterisk on the box indicates the zoomed region in (b). b A blown up view of the boxed in region of (a) indicated by an asterisk. Desirable and off-type bermudagrasses that were analyzed by GBS but did not cluster in this region included the following samples: S4, S16, S31, S33, and S45\n                      Table 2\n                        The number of nucleotide variants with different genotypes between each pair of triploid hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x C. transvaalensis) cultivars\n                      CultivarNumber of nucleotide variants ChampionMiniVerdeTifdwarfTifEagleTifgreenChampion-----MiniVerde4003----Tifdwarf40863404---TifEagle428134894299--Tifgreen3969302844764088-Tifway35,10429,61437,80236,79636,838\n                      The variants were filtered to loci with a read depth of at least 40 but less than 100 per cultivar. Variants were included if they were homozygous for the reference allele in one cultivar and homozygous for the alternate allele in the other cultivar or if they were homozygous in one cultivar and heterozygous in the other\n                    \n                The pooled data from variants among triploid cultivars still encompassed individual loci with both very low and very high individual read depths. Low read depth could miss heterozygotes, whereas high read depth could indicate a repetitive region instead of an individual locus. To mitigate read depth issues, a further filter was applied to identify only the most robust variants with a sequence read depth of at least 40, but no more than 100. The upper limit was set to filter reads originating from repetitive elements where detected variation is not likely to be from a single locus. Filtering using these read depths yielded 93,188 variants between at least two genotypes (Table 2).\n                The MDS plot revealed clear clustering of the diploid (DA1–3 and DB1–3) and tetraploid progenitor species (TA1–3 and TB1–3) apart from the standard hybrid bermudagrass cultivars (CH1–6, MV1–6, TD1–6, TE1–6, TG1–6, and TW1–6) and the majority of samples harvested from putting greens (Fig. 3a). The two progenitor species also clustered separately from one another with the exception of DA2 due to possible contamination during DNA isolation. The clustering demonstrated that GBS was effective for distinguishing diploid, triploid, and tetraploid bermudagrasses. The ability to distinguish among bermudagrass species is likely due to the large number of unshared variants (Fig. 2).\n              Phenotypic evaluation\n                The K-means cluster algorithm yielded three clusters containing 14, 26, and 12 samples, respectively. Cluster one contained nine off-type and five desirable samples, cluster two had 12 off-types and 14 desirables, and cluster three had eight off-types and four desirable samples. The cluster analysis overall expected R\n                           2\n                   was 0.61 with a cubic clustering criterion of -19.36. Cluster means and standard deviations for each morphological assessment are presented in Fig. 4. Internode length, leaf length, and LWR were the only statistically different morphological parameters among clusters (Fig. 4). A representative hybrid bermudagrass sample from each cluster is illustrated in Fig. 5.\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Cluster means and standard deviations for internode length, leaf length, leaf length:width ratio, stolon diameter, and leaf width measurements. Morphological parameters were assessed using methods similar to Roche and Loch [37]. Measurements were made on 52 off-type and desirable hybrid bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) samples harvested from golf course putting greens in the southeastern United States. Cluster means and standard deviations were generated from the K-means algorithm in SAS Enterprise 6.1 and graphed using Prism 6.0 for Mac. Statistical differences were determined using standard deviations\n                      \n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Photographs of bermudagrass samples representative of each morphological cluster. Cluster analysis was performed using a K-means algorithm in SAS Enterprise Guide (Version 6.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) with cluster means and standard deviations graphed in Prism (Prism 6 for Mac OS X; GraphPad Software, Inc.) to determine statistical differences. Grasses in cluster one had significantly longer internode lengths than those within clusters two and three. Grasses in cluster three had significantly longer leaves than those in clusters one and two. Figure was generated using Keynote (v6.6.2)\n                      \n                The average internode length for grasses in cluster one (34.6 mm) was significantly longer than the grasses within clusters two (21.9 mm) and three (24.7 mm) (Fig. 4). Grasses in cluster three had significantly longer leaves than those grouped in clusters one and two (Fig. 4). The leaf length mean for cluster three was 29.8 mm, compared to 14.9 and 9.9 mm for clusters one and two, respectively (Fig. 4). This relationship was also present in LWR among clusters (Fig. 3). Stolon diameter ranged from 0.7 to 0.8 mm and leaf width ranged from 2.0 to 2.2 mm, with no statistical differences present among clusters for either parameter.\n              DiscussionGenotyping-by-sequencing\n                Caetano-Anollés [9] and Caetano-Anollés et al. [10] revealed that eight of 16 off-types were genetically divergent from standard cultivars using DAF, leading researchers to conclude that off-types that were not genetically distinct, but were the result of somatic mutations within ‘Tifgreen’ and ‘Tifdwarf’. The inability of GBS, as well as other molecular marker techniques, to distinguish off-types from hybrid bermudagrass cultivars used on putting greens could be the result of aneuploidy within the ‘Tifgreen’-cultivar family (B.M. Schwartz, unpublished data, 2016; [36]). Reasor et al. [36] suggested that aneuploidy could have resulted during the original hybridization of ‘Tifgreen’ or through intense putting green management techniques. It is expected that some variant locations are not going to be sampled by random chance due to the sparse nature of the GBS analysis. This is a limitation of GBS because it cannot determine presence/absence or copy number variations for individual locations that are needed to determine aneuploidy [13]. There were a total of 93,188 variants shared between at least two genotypes (Table 2); however, our experiment only included six biological replications of each standard cultivar from a single geographic location (Tifton, GA). Additional research and replication of this study with more samples will be needed to ascertain which variants can be used to identify standard hybrid bermudagrass cultivars, specifically hybrid ultradwarf cultivars, from one another.\n                Despite also being a triploid hybrid, ‘Tifway’ bermudagrass has been genetically distinguished from ‘Tifgreen’-cultivar family using SSRs [20, 24, 40] and AFLPs [12, 41]. Arumuganathan et al. [1] reported that ‘Tifway’ had less nuclear DNA content (1.37 ± 0.01 pg/2C) than ‘Tifgreen’ (1.61 ± 0.00 pg/2C) despite having the same number of chromosomes. Furthermore, Reasor et al. [36] hypothesized that this difference in DNA content could also be a result of aneuploidy in the ‘Tifgreen’-cultivar family of hybrid bermudagrass, which includes the hybrid ultradwarf cultivars. This difference in DNA content could also aid in genetic identification between hybrid bermudagrasses using GBS. In addition to the identification of ‘Tifway’ from other triploid hybrids, the ability of GBS to distinguish diploid, triploid, and tetraploid bermudagrasses align with previous efforts to genetically identify these grasses from one another using AFLPs [12, 41] and SSRs [20, 24, 40].\n                It is not clear why the majority of grasses included in our experiment exhibited variable morphological characteristics while being similar in genotype. The majority of bermudagrass cultivars established on golf course putting greens were selected from other bermudagrass cultivars [36]. The off-type grasses studied in this experiment were also selected from existing cultivars. Differential gene expression driven by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and small RNA expression may also be a possible explanation for the genetic similarities among hybrid bermudagrass samples varying in phenotype [39]. Multiple genes control important turfgrass traits and gene expression can be greatly influenced by environment or management practices [14]. Golf course putting greens are intensely managed surfaces subjected to daily mowing (often at heights of cut =3 mm), annual aerification and cultivation, as well as treatment with plant growth regulators and silica sand topdressing on a weekly basis. Any of these practices or other environmental influences could cause lasting epigenetic effects that result in the up or down regulation of genes associated with hybrid bermudagrass phenotypic characteristics; however, no research has been conducted on this possibility. Studying changes in gene expression as a result of these maintenance practices could benefit researchers and industry practitioners to better understand how putting green management could potentially lead to the occurrence of phenotypically different off-type grasses in hybrid bermudagrass putting surfaces and generate new hypotheses into how these changes are induced.\n              Phenotypic evaluation\n                The internode length of grasses in this experiment align with Magni et al. [31] who reported an internode length range of 15 to 34 mm on ultradwarf hybrid bermudagrass cultivars used on putting greens. However, Roche and Loch [37] reported internode lengths of 9.4 to 12.5 mm for hybrid bermudagrasses used on putting greens. In our experiment, mean internode length for each cluster was in the uppermost half of the internode length range reported by Magni et al. [31] and greater than the range measured by Roche and Loch [37]. Internode lengths measured in this experiment varied greatly among desirable and off-type grasses as well as grasses measured in other experiments. This is an indication of the amount of phenotypic variability that can occur in individual putting greens as well as from golf course-to-golf course and cultivar-to-cultivar. Differences in internode length within the same putting surface can lead to decreased turfgrass density and reductions in putting surface quality and playability [36]. Similar to the internode length data, leaf length values (and subsequently LWR values) documented in our experiment were far greater than those reported by Roche and Loch [37]. Stolon diameter and leaf width values were similar to those reported by Roche and Loch [37], but less than those reported by Magni et al. [31].\n              ConclusionsOff-type grasses reported to have phenotypic differences from standard hybrid bermudagrass cultivars were sampled from golf course putting greens and subjected to GBS and morphological characterization under controlled growth conditions. Genotyping-by-sequencing only distinguished five off-type grasses from standard hybrid bermudagrass cultivars. In addition, GBS failed to completely distinguish standard hybrid bermudagrass cultivars from one another, including ‘Champion’, ‘MiniVerde’, ‘Tifdwarf’, ‘TifEagle’, and ‘Tifgreen’. These results are not unexpected given their common origin. The final bioinformatics analysis did yield 93,188 variants that offer the potential to be useful in distinguishing standard cultivars from one another; however, additional research beyond the scope if this project would be needed to determine which ones are diagnostic. GBS was successful in determining triploid hybrid bermudagrass cultivars from two diploid and tetraploid progenitor samples. Additionally, GBS was also successful in determining triploid hybrid bermudagrass cultivars with lineage to ‘Tifgreen’ from those not developed from ‘Tifgreen’ (e.g., ‘Tifway’). Morphological characteristics varied among sampled grasses that allowed them to be clustered into three distinct phenotypic groups varying predominately in internode and leaf length.DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Qi Sun, Jeffe Dunne, Sarah Boggess, Anne Hatmaker, Monil Mehta, Laura Poplawski, Sujata Agarwal, Javier Vargas, Tyler Campbell, Jimmy Greenway, Greg Breeden, Daniel Farnsworth, Trevor Mills, Mitchell Riffey, Kelly Arnholt, Jason Burris, Amanda Webb, Rebecca Grantham, Gerald Henry, and John Sorochan for assistance with this project.

The published scientific literature gives few hints of these problems and there is a danger that they will be forgotten.The First World War was largely indiscriminate in its carnage, but World War 2 and the preceding years of fascism were associated with widespread migration, especially of Jewish workers expelled from Germany, and of their children, a number of whom would become major contributors to the post-war generation of human and medical geneticists in Britain and America. In Germany itself, eminent geneticists were also involved in the abuses carried out in the name of ‘eugenics’ and ‘race biology’. However, geneticists in America, Britain and the rest of Europe were largely responsible for the ideological foundations of these abuses.In the Soviet Union, geneticists and genetics itself became the object of persecution from the 1930s till as late as the mid 1960s, with an almost complete destruction of the field during this time; this extended also to Eastern Europe and China as part of the influence of Russian communism. Most recently, at the end of the twentieth century, China saw a renewal of government sponsored eugenics programmes, now mostly discarded.During the post-world war 2 decades, human genetics research benefited greatly from recognition of the genetic dangers posed by exposure to radiation, following the atomic bomb explosions in Japan, atmospheric testing and successive accidental nuclear disasters in Russia.Documenting and remembering these traumatic events, now largely forgotten among younger workers, is essential if we are to fully understand the history of human genetics and avoid the repetition of similar disasters in the future. The power of modern human genetic and genomic techniques now gives a greater potential for abuse as well as for beneficial use than has ever been seen in the past.KeywordsHistoryHumanMedicineMedicalGeneticsWarRussiaethicsBackground\n                ‘We shall go to the pyre, we shall burn, but we shall not retreat from our convictions. I tell you, in all frankness, that I believed and still believe and insist on what is right, and not only believe - because taking things on faith in science is nonsense - but also say what I know on the basis of wide experience. This is a fact, and to retreat from it simply because some occupying high posts desire it, is impossible.’\n              From speech of N.I. Vavilov to All Union Institute of Plant Breeding, USSR. March 1939 (from Medvedev [1]).This quotation from Nikolai Vavilov, at the height of the greatest crisis that modern genetics, including human genetics, has ever faced during its existence, may seem now to be an echo from the distant past, but the issues that Vavilov, perhaps Russia’s greatest scientist ever, had to confront are as relevant to us today as they were in the troubled times of Soviet Russia under Stalin’s ‘great terror’. I shall return to the story of the destruction of genetics in Russia later, but it is only one, though probably the most extreme, of a number of traumatic events in the history of the field.Over the period of little more than a century since the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900, genetics, especially human genetics, has rarely had a peaceful existence. From the rapid pace of scientific and medical advances one would not think that this was the case, nor does the published literature in journals and books indicate the successive crises that often involved its workers, both professionally and in their personal lives. It is only through the less scientific writings by or about these workers, and in recent years through recorded interviews with those involved, that one begins to appreciate the traumatic background to much of their work. I attempt here to document what can only be small fragments of their stories as a belated tribute to their experiences and sufferings, and those of others across the world who did not survive to pursue their work further.World war 1The first decade after the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in 1900 saw a sudden burst of new insights into human genetics, even though Mendel’s work itself, and that of his discoverers, had been primarily on plants. The enthusiasm of William Bateson in England and his links with physicians involved with hereditary disorders soon established the universality of Mendelism, and the medical world was quick to take up the field. Archibald Garrod’s studies of the inheritance of alkaptonuria [2] (in collaboration with Bateson) and of other inherited metabolic disorders established the concept of ‘inborn errors of metabolism’ (Garrod [3]), while numerous previously published family studies of inherited eye, skeletal and neurological conditions now fell into place as following specific patterns of mendelian inheritance, forming the foundations for the ‘Treasury of Human Inheritance’, initiated by Karl Pearson in 1909 and developed extensively over the next half century by his colleague Julia Bell [4].By the time that Bateson published the definitive edition of his ‘Mendel’s Principles of Heredity’, also in 1909 [5], there was abundant observational evidence on the basic patterns of human inheritance, yet soon the momentum would shift to America with the beginnings of experimental research on Drosophila by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues. In 1914 European work came to an almost complete halt with the outbreak of war, while American research could continue largely unhindered.In personal terms the effects of World War 1 were devastating, though for genetics the situation was probably little different from other areas of science. JBS Haldane’s publication of the discovery of genetic linkage in mammals (mice) was delayed by his co-author Sprunt being killed in battle; Haldane himself (Fig. 1a) was severely wounded and, fearing that he also might not survive, had to write to his friend and colleague William Bateson:\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Early workers in human genetics and World War 1 (see text for details). a.

In the event, Haldane survived and the paper was duly published, possibly the only such paper to be submitted from the battlefield (Haldane et al. [7]).Archibald Garrod (Fig. 1b) lost all of his three sons in the war, two in combat, the third in the 1918 influenza pandemic; according to his biographer Alexander Bearn he never recovered from this blow (Bearn [8]), though he went on to produce what is perhaps his most insightful book, ‘The Inborn Factors in Disease’ (Garrod [9]) late in his life. There must have been many other such tragedies across the world. In France one of the few early proponents of mendelism, Lucien Cuénot, had all his research stocks of mice destroyed and was unable to continue work on genetics.There were some small positive notes to come out of the conflict. In Britain, Julia Bell (Fig. 2) took the opportunity of most men being away in the armed forces, to train and qualify in Medicine; she had until then been finding it difficult, as a mathematician working on the ‘Treasury of Human Inheritance’ with Karl Pearson, to gain the cooperation that she needed from the physicians (Harper [4]). And on the Macedonian front of the war, the husband and wife team of the Hirszfelds, working in the blood transfusion service, were the first to recognise ethnic differences in blood group frequency between the different population groups involved (Hirszfeld L and Hirszfeld H [10]).\n                    \n                  Fig. 2\n                      Julia Bell (1879–1979), principal author of the Treasury of Human Inheritance; originally trained in mathematics, but gained a medical qualification during World War 1. (Courtesy of Journal of Medical Biography and the late Professor Sarah Bundey)\n                    The first decades following the end of the war provided a respite during which European science could recover and begin to advance again, while awareness of the importance of genetics spread rapidly across the world from the initial centres in Britain, America and Scandinavia. Human genetics was prominent in the work of more general geneticists such as JBS Haldane and Lancelot Hogben in Britain, while workers such as Norwegian physician Otto Lous Mohr also spent time studying classical genetics with Morgan and Sturtevant. In Russia the brilliant plant geneticist Nikolai Vavilov (Fig. 3), who had studied in Britain with Bateson (and had almost died on his return journey when his ship was sunk at the beginning of World war 1) had developed an extensive network of research institutes across what had now become the USSR. He had also made links with Hermann Muller in America and had sent students to train with him, including Solomon Levit who, as described below, was to become director of the remarkable Moscow Institute of Medical Genetics. By the early 1930s genetics, with human genetics prominent within it, had become a flourishing science internationally, with a closely knit research community.\n                    \n                  Fig. 3\n                      Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943), plant and evolutionary geneticist; promoter of genetics overall in the new Soviet Union. (Courtesy of the John Innes Foundation)\n                    The respite would not last long however, and during the 1930s two different, though not entirely separate shadows were beginning to fall across the field; in Germany Hitler’s coming to power in 1933 led at once to the dismissal and in many cases expulsion of Jewish scientists from the universities, and to the ‘eugenics law’ of the same year. In Russia, the opposition of Stalin and his agents, notably Trofim Lysenko, to orthodox genetics led to its near total destruction. In contrast to the somewhat random destruction seen in World War 1, these two disastrous and long lasting chapters were largely focused specifically on genetics and geneticists, especially those involved in human genetics. I shall consider the Russian situation first.The destruction of Russian geneticsDuring the twenty or so years since Vavilov had returned to Russia from Britain, science in general and genetics in particular had made spectacular advances in the new USSR, largely due to funding support on a massive scale, with the backing of Lenin himself. The main focus was on plant genetics, understandably so given the problems posed by recurrent famine, the hostile climate and the backward attitudes of the Russian peasantry. When William Bateson visited his former student in 1925 he was astounded by the sheer scale of Vavilov’s operations – 400 research stations across the entire Soviet Union, with around 20,000 workers in all (Vavilov [11]). Vavilov himself had led a series of research expeditions to areas such as Central Asia, North Africa and South America, which he considered to be likely centres for the origins of the key domestic food crops, notably grains, and he set up a far sighted programme of seed banks and of breeding programmes from these expeditions. But Vavilov’s aims extended far beyond plant genetics and included the promotion of human genetics, notably by medically trained workers such as Solomon Levit, who became head of the new Moscow Medical Genetics Institute. There were also other distinguished workers in the genetics field, most notably Nikolai Koltsov, whose work in the area of cell biology and especially the roles and structure of macromolecules such as nucleic acids [12], can be regarded as forerunners in the 1930s of the much later workers in molecular biology.One area of human genetics where Russian scientists were considerably ahead of their western counterparts was human cytogenetics. Here they had managed to overcome some of the major technological barriers that were holding back progress, anticipating the West by 20 years or more in the use of hypotonic solutions to spread chromosomes, and the use of mitotic stimulants to allow the chromosomes of peripheral blood to be studied, rather than being dependent on dividing tissues such as bone marrow or testis which required more invasive procedures to obtain them. But the range of studies was wide, spanning population genetics, statistical studies and analysis of families with mendelian disorders, as well as of common conditions such as diabetes, as can be seen in the four published volumes of ‘annual reports’ from the Moscow Medical Genetics Institute, edited by its director, Solomon Levit, with its final volume in 1936. Work from the Institute was also published in mainstream Western journals, making the Russian workers part of the international network of geneticists, while Levit and some others were allowed to travel abroad to spend a year or more working in the laboratories of eminent geneticists such as Hermann Muller. A sympathetic account of Levit’s life and tragic death has been written by Dalia Epstein, (though not yet published outside a museum bulletin). Born in humble circumstances to a Lithuanian Jewish family, he was an ardent communist and one of the many betrayed by the revolution that he had supported.All of this immensely productive activity in Soviet genetics was cut off abruptly in late 1936, when politically based criticism of genetics that had been increasing for several years erupted into a full blown crisis. Organised by Lysenko and his colleague the political theoretician Isaac Prezent, but with the full support of Stalin from an early stage, a ‘debate’ was held, which served to identify and hence incriminate the key supporters of mendelian genetics, who clearly won the scientific arguments, but the political battle had been lost in advance. Like Lysenko, Stalin was a strong proponent of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, not just in plants but for humans also, where ideas of malleable inheritance were more congenial to communist ideology than were the more fixed concepts of inheritance based on genes and chromosomes. Lysenko himself was a largely uneducated plant breeder, whose work was later shown to be largely erroneous, unrepeatable when performed under rigorous conditions (see below) and probably fraudulent, and whose agricultural policy of ‘vernalisation’ of wheat, based on supposed modification of its inherited character by freezing and thawing prior to sowing, resulted in disastrous crop failures.Although the experimental work on plants did not directly involve human genetics, this was in fact in the front line for criticism, partly because some of the early workers in the field, including Koltsov, had been previously associated with eugenics, usually in rather vague and idealistic forms. But by the mid 1930s the abuses of eugenics that were beginning to occur in Nazi Germany were becoming known in Russia, and the whole of classical genetics became tarred with the same brush. The situation was aggravated by the fact that Vavilov, after years of lobbying his friends in the West, had succeeded in persuading both the congress organisers and the Soviet authorities to have the 1937 International Genetics Congress held in Moscow. By 1936 the thought of having numerous independent minded and mostly critical international scientists visiting Russia was too much for Stalin and his colleagues; first all presentations involving human genetics were banned, then the programme and speakers were to be chosen by the Soviet delegation, and finally the Congress was completely cancelled at short notice.A further factor that made matters still worse was the involvement of Hermann Muller (see Carlson [13]) [14], already world famous from his discovery of genetic mutations due to irradiation in Drosophila. Muller, like a number of other Western geneticists, was an ardent communist and supporter of Soviet Russia; his earlier turbulent history included dismissal from the University of Texas for supporting student activists, which led him to leave America and accept a post with the outstanding Russian geneticist Nikolai Timoffeef-Resovsky, who was at the time (1932) working in Berlin. But the coming to power of the Nazis the following year made Berlin impossible for Muller, who then took up an open invitation from Vavilov to move to Russia. Here he made an immediate and lasting mark, founding groups involved in mutation research that flourished. But genetics was becoming increasingly beleaguered and in a fatal misjudgement Muller decided in 1936 to write directly to Stalin, enclosing his recently published book Out of the Night (Muller [14]) [15], in part of which he expressed his utopian ideas, written many years before, on the benefits of eugenics, which he naively considered might flourish under the Soviet system. Stalin, an avid reader, had the book translated and was appalled by it, with the result that the sequence of events leading to the destruction of Russian genetics was set in motion.Early in 1937 the Moscow Institute of Medical Genetics (Fig. 4) was abruptly closed, its director Levit (Fig. 5) was dismissed, imprisoned, and subsequently shot, as were a number of other geneticists; Muller, helped by Vavilov, escaped to join the Spanish civil war; Koltsov, after being dismissed from his posts, died suddenly (perhaps poisoned, perhaps a natural occurrence) and his wife committed suicide. Timoffeef-Resovsky remained precariously in Berlin until the end of the war, when he was arrested and placed in a concentration camp. Vavilov was dismissed but remained free until 1940, when he was arrested while on his final field expedition; he died from starvation in prison in 1943 despite repeated international calls for his release (Popovsky [15]) [16]. The 7th International Genetics Congress was finally held in August 1939 in Edinburgh, on the verge of the outbreak of World War 2; Vavilov had been elected President, despite no-one knowing whether he was still alive, and a symbolic empty chair was left for him on the podium. Russian genetics, including human genetics, had been essentially destroyed and would remain almost non-existent for the next 25 years.\n                    \n                  Fig. 4\n                      The destruction of Russian human genetics (photographs courtesy of Dalia Epstein, Lithuanian Historical Museum, Vilnius).a.

(Courtesy of Paediatric Research Unit, Guy’s Hospital, London)\n                    Human genetics and Nazi GermanyWhile the process of ascent followed by catastrophic fall was being played out so dramatically in Soviet Russia, human genetics was also involved in disturbing events in Germany; the key difference from the Russian tragedy is that geneticists were not the victims but were among the perpetrators and abettors of some of the worst crimes the world has ever seen. I do not attempt to discuss this chapter of events, or the topic of eugenics here in any detail, but it cannot be overlooked.Around the time of World War 1 Germany was in the forefront of genetics research, as in most other fields of science, and in 1921 three of its leading geneticists, Erwin Baur, Eugen Fischer and Fritz Lenz, published what rapidly became the standard book on human genetics, Menschliche Erblichkeitslehre, translated into English in 1931 under the title Human Heredity [16]. The book ran to several editions and was apparently read by Adolf Hitler while in prison during the 1920s. At first sight the book appears to be a fairly standard textbook, giving a thorough and up to date grounding in the subject, but in some long chapters, mainly on anthropology, scientific description is mixed with prejudicial comments on racial characteristics and their superiority or inferiority, which increase and alter with successive editions.Both Lenz and Fischer were Nazi party members, as were some other leading German geneticists, including Ernst Rudin and Otmar von Verschuer, so it is not surprising that when the ‘Law for the prevention of progeny with hereditary defects’ was enacted in July 1933, only six months after the Nazis came to power, its foundations had already been prepared, largely by the leading geneticists in the country.Shortly before this, in April 1933, all Jewish University staff were dismissed from their posts immediately, leading to the flight of many of those able to leave the country (around 2600 in the first year alone) and to the catastrophic loss of talent from German science which took generations to repair. A remarkable book, Hitler’s Gift, (Medawar and Pyke [17]) gives details on the many talented scientists lost to Germany, and gained mainly by Britain and America, as a result. The book focuses on physicists, but there were a number of biochemists (eg: Max Perutz, Hans Krebs, Hermann Lehmann), as well as geneticists (Hans Grueneberg, Hans Kalmus, Charlotte Auerbach), who were found posts in London, Edinburgh and other British University centres, and who subsequently developed outstanding careers there. Those moving to America included Richard Goldschmidt and Curt Stern among others. Not all made the journey successfully, though. Arno Motulsky (Fig. 5a), who later in Seattle was to become one of the three key founders of North American medical genetics (along with Victor McKusick in Baltimore and F Clarke Fraser in Montreal), has told how his emigrant ship came into sight of the American coast but was refused entry and had to return to Europe, before he eventually reached America several years later [18].The story of the finding of posts for these individuals in Britain by the Government-supported Academic Assistance Council is a heart-warming one, even though it can be regarded with hindsight as ‘enlightened self-interest’; people notably involved included JBS Haldane, then at University College, London, and William Beveridge, head of London School of Economics and subsequently the founder of Britain’s post-war ‘welfare state’.Many of the Jewish refugees came with their young families, while a number of unaccompanied children came on the ‘Kindertransport’ trains from Berlin and Vienna immediately before the war began. It is this younger generation who make up a sizeable number of the post-war founders of human and medical genetics with whom I was able to make recorded interviews in my own series. Too young to be among those geneticists already established in their own countries, their lives were nonetheless profoundly affected by the war. I cannot give their stories in full here, but they can be read in the interview transcripts of the series, on the website of the Genetics and Medicine Historical Network (www.genmedhist.org/interviews) and they also receive mention in an article on the interview series as a whole [19]. The situation was strikingly comparable to that of today’s influx of refugees from across the world, and one wonders how history will judge our reception of these children by comparison with that of the earlier group.Life was often far from easy for these refugees and on the outbreak of war a number of them were interned in a camp on the Isle of Man, initially alongside British Nazis. Some were then transported further to Canada, including those, mainly of Italian origin, on the ill-fated ship Arandora Star, which was sunk in the Atlantic with heavy loss of life. Paul Polani (Fig. 5b), one of the key founders of British medical genetics, who had come to Britain to undertake research and was then interned when Italy entered the war, narrowly missed being on the Arandora Star by being called to London to provide locum cover for a sick paediatrician, a position which turned out to last for the entire war and led to his subsequent career in medical genetics at nearby Guy’s Hospital. Ursula Mittwoch, who had come with her parents from Berlin just before the war aged 15, found herself interned as soon as she reached her 16th birthday. Later she made a distinguished career at University College, London.The Isle of Man camp is documented in the book Island of Barbed Wire (Chappell [20]) but is perhaps described most memorably in molecular biologist Max Perutz’s essay ‘Enemy Alien’. This reflects his stoicism and humour in adversity and his recognition that most of what ill treatment there was came from bureaucracy and confusion as to who this heterogeneous assembly of internees actually were. As Perutz comments [21], on his way to the Isle of Man:\n                  \n                    Our camp commander was a white-moustached veteran of the last war; then a German had been a German, but now the subtle distinctions between friend and foe bewildered him. Watching a group of internees with skullcaps and curly side-whiskers arrive at his camp, he mused, ‘I had no idea there were so many Jews among the Nazis’. He pronounced it ‘Nasis’.\n                  \n                Continental Europe, rapidly overrun by Hitler’s troops, was no refuge for Jewish or anti-fascist geneticists, and many must have perished. Among them was Eugene Wollman, microbial geneticist and father of Elie Wollman, molecular biologist colleague of Jacques Monod and François Jacob, both of whom fought with the French resistance, Monod himself helping to lead the liberation of Paris by its inhabitants. Among younger French workers that I have been able to interview, biochemical geneticist Jean-Claude Kaplan had to live under an assumed identity in occupied France, as also did Robert Debré, founder of post-war medical genetics in France.World war twoThe 7th international Genetics Congress, cancelled by Moscow, as already mentioned, eventually met in Edinburgh in 1939, on the eve of the outbreak of war; it had to be concluded early, but it left a permanent memorial in the form of the Geneticists’ Manifesto, drafted primarily by Hermann Muller (now back from Spain and working in the Edinburgh department of Frank Crew), but signed by a number of other prominent geneticists (anon 1939) [22]. Coupling the science of genetics firmly to issues of social progress and freedom, the Manifesto at least ensured that the future of human genetics could be seen as a progressive and enlightened one, not tied for ever to the reactionary forces of eugenics and Nazi Germany. There was to be much strife, though, before the challenges of the Manifesto could be picked up at the end of the conflict six years later.A reminder that the world was now at war came rapidly, with the sinking in mid Atlantic of the ship Athena carrying many of the returning American congress participants, as recounted by Arthur Steinberg, who was travelling in a separate ship that helped to rescue survivors (Jenkins [23]). Some of the Polish geneticists remained in Edinburgh permanently, their home country now invaded and partitioned as a result of the Nazi-Russian pact. For the following months the ‘phoney war’ gave an illusion of calm across Western Europe, at least on land, but this was abruptly shattered by the German ‘blitzkrieg’ on the Low Countries, Scandinavia and then France.A geneticist’s viewpoint of these dramatic events can be seen from the perspective of Norway, where classical genetics and a considerable amount of human genetics research were flourishing in a modest way under the leadership of Otto Lous Mohr, a physician and geneticist trained in America under Thomas Hunt Morgan. The genetics community there had closed ranks firmly to oppose the eugenic and pro-Nazi views of some anthropologists, notably Alfred Mjoen, and had invited Lancelot Hogben from Britain, also outspoken in his opposition to eugenics, to give a lecture in Oslo. The minutes of the meeting have been preserved. Next morning, while Hogben (with his daughter) was being driven to the airport to return to London, they encountered columns of German troops, part of the invading force, but fortunately they were able to divert and travel on a remote road across the border with neutral Sweden, where he was looked after by his friend Gunnar Dahlberg, another committed anti-eugenicist. It took him almost three years to get home, though, after travelling East through Russia, on the trans-Siberian railway, to Japan and then across the Pacific to America [24]. Back in Norway, Mohr was dismissed and imprisoned under the puppet ‘Quisling’ regime, but later became Rector of Oslo University and survived to see his nephew, Jan Mohr, become one of the leaders of post-war European Human Genetics.The wartime role of Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob in France has already been mentioned. Jacob was severely wounded in the Normandy landings, ending his hopes of becoming a surgeon but allowing him to become one of the leaders of molecular biology. His future colleague Jacques Monod had an even more dramatic role, becoming leader of the communist led underground resistance that led to the liberation of Paris in 1944. Almost unbelievably he managed to combine this with continued research at Institut Pasteur. Horace Judson [25], in his book ‘The Eighth Day of Creation’, gives a vivid account of these remarkable years, based on numerous interviews with those involved.On the other side of the world geneticists were no more immune to catastrophe than their European counterparts. China had already been invaded by Japan, largely destroying the promising beginnings that were developing largely as the results of links with America. Thus population geneticist CC Li (Fig. 6a), after studying agriculture and genetics in Nanking, came to Cornell University for a PhD, returning to China under exceptionally difficult wartime conditions, including a 38 day walk together with his pregnant wife, eventually reaching Kweilin, beyond the area of Japanese control. After the war he was appointed as professor at Peking University, where he wrote his book on human population genetics, but following the communist revolution in 1949, which brought with it Russian Lysenkoist doctrines, he was forced to leave. The rest of his life was spent based at University of Pittsburgh (Spiess [26]).\n                    \n                  Fig. 6\n                      Human geneticists in the far East and World War 2 (see text). a.

(Courtesy of Professor Henry Harris)\n                    Another scientist of Chinese origin who suffered lasting scars from the war was Joe Hin Tjio (Fig. 6b), brought up in Indonesia and interned and tortured successively under the Japanese during the war and then as a communist supporter under the new government. Eventually he made his way to the Netherlands, being awarded a scholarship to study genetics across Europe; this allowed him to establish a university base in Zaragosa, Spain as well as to make links with Albert Levan in Lund, Sweden, where he spent summers and vacations. This collaboration led to the realisation that the human chromosome number was 46, not 48 as had been erroneously believed for the previous 30 years (Tjio and Levan [27]). Tjio’s later years were spent in America, mainly at the National Institutes of Health.In Japan human genetics had also made a promising start in the 1930s, notable contributions including the recognition of mitochondrial inheritance as the basis for Leber’s optic atrophy (Imai and Moriwaki [28]). The war halted this progress, not only in Japan itself, but also in America, where after the Pearl Harbor bombing, Japanese-American citizens were interned in the same way as their European counterparts in Britain, including cytogeneticist Masuo Kodani (1913–1983). The profound consequences on Kodani’s life and career are described by Smocovitis [29] and the entire internment process appears to have been more inhuman than that in Britain, though several internees, including Kodani, managed to continue valuable cytogenetics research in collaboration with outside scientists. But Japan’s principal role in human genetics has resulted from the terrible blow suffered by the populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki when the atomic bombs were dropped that ended World War 2. By this time it was already recognised, thanks to the work of Muller and others, that irradiation could cause genetic mutations, but little was known about how this might translate into genetic disorders and birth defects in a real population.With the war’s abrupt end both politicians and geneticists recognised that the dangers from radiation threatened not only Japan’s bombed cities but the entire world; the practical result of this concern was the American led ‘Japanese Atomic Bomb Study’, which aimed to detect and as far as possible estimate the genetic effects of the explosions. Very wisely, and perhaps unexpectedly so soon after a war, the American organisers decided to bring Japanese scientists into partnership for the study, not only facilitating the project but stimulating a strong scientific tradition for Japan in radiation genetics and human cytogenetics that continues to the present.The project director was James Neel (Fig. 7), a physician and geneticist who saw that much more needed to be known about human genetics in general if the Atomic Bomb Study were to be interpreted meaningfully. This was the start of the close and long lasting links between human genetics and radiation biology that resulted in rapid growth of the field across the world over the next two decades, as described further below. There were wider benefits, too, since some of the American investigators, based in Japan for a number of years, became closely identified with Japanese culture and social life, helping to restore, at least in a small way, the links broken by the war. The book Song among the Ruins, by geneticist William Schull, (Schull [30]) provides perhaps the best example of this.\n                    \n                  Fig. 7\n                      JH Neel (1915–2000), leader of the US atomic bomb genetics studies. (Courtesy of American Philosophical Society)\n                    Aftermath: the post-war rebirth and development of human geneticsRadiation and human genetics\n                The years after the end of World War 2 were not easy ones, whether for scientists or for people as a whole. In Europe especially, reconstruction, both physical and social, took priority over other matters, though the foundations that were laid for universal healthcare in countries such as France, Britain and the Netherlands greatly facilitated the development of medical genetics services two decades later. Research funding was rapidly restored, with the dangers from irradiation making human genetics a priority area. This requires further discussion here, and is an important general historical topic too.\n                It rapidly became clear, as already mentioned, that the problem of atomic radiation was a world-wide one. Atmospheric fallout from nuclear testing, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the growing ‘cold war’ all gave intense political as well as public concern, so that genetics, and especially human genetics, became a strong focus for research institutes worldwide. This also affected the university systems, with chairs in human genetics established and funding of projects only tenuously related to radiation. The First International Human Genetics Congress, held in Copenhagen in 1956, likewise laid a heavy emphasis on the genetic dangers from radiation.\n                The UK Medical Research Council’s two main units concerned with radiation, in Edinburgh and Harwell, provide a good example of how radiation related research benefited human genetics as a whole, by helping to develop new techniques such as the analysis of human chromosomes, and also by their foresight in supporting work which might have seemed beyond their remit, such as studies of Down’s syndrome and of sex chromosome abnormalities. I have been able to interview a number of these workers (see www.genmedhist.org/interviews) including Patricia Jacobs, Mary Lyon and Anthony Searle, and the interview transcripts provide a striking example of the freedom that they had in the range of their research topics.\n                The situation in Russia provides the most extreme example in this field of radiation genetics. Despite Lysenko’s suppression of genetics in the research institutes, and after 1948 in the universities also, he had no authority over one area, that of atomic energy, where in the desperate haste to catch up with the West its directors had ‘carte blanche’ to employ who they wished and to undertake all types of research. Safety considerations were minimal or absent, and the situation became critical following a massive explosion of buried nuclear waste at the secret Urals atomic research station, which spread radiation over a wide area of Russia – but not outside its borders, thus avoiding international detection (Medvedev [31]).\n                There was clearly a need for information on likely short- and long-term effects, especially genetic damage, but there were virtually no scientists left with expertise in this area since Lysenko and Stalin’s purges of geneticists, which had continued after the war. The only suitable survivor was Nikolai Timoffeef-Resovsky (Fig. 8a), mentioned earlier, who had been brought back from Berlin and imprisoned. Close to death, he was released, restored to tolerable health and placed in charge of a new radiation research unit, whose staff, bizarrely, were all political prisoners, including himself.\n                      \n                    Fig. 8\n                        Survivors and re-creators of Russian human genetics. a Nikolai Timoffeef-Resovsky (1900–1981), one of the very few survivors of the destruction of Russian genetics by Stalin and Lysenko. (Courtesy of Professor V Ivanov). b Nikolai Bochkov, Yevgeny Ginter and Vladimir Ivanov, the first three directors of the renewed Moscow Medical Genetics Institute, all former students of Timoffeef-Resovsky. (Courtesy of European Society of Human Genetics)\n                      \n                Subsequently Timoffeef-Resovsky, still distrusted politically, went to Obninsk, not far from Moscow, where he led a unit which provided the tenuous beginnings for a revival of human genetics at the end of the 1960s, after Lysenko had finally been discredited. The renewed Moscow Medical Genetics Institute has been directed successively by three of Timoffeef-Resovsky’s workers (Fig. 8b), a striking example of a ‘founder effect’ resulting from the elimination of most, but not quite all, of Russia’s geneticists.\n                Despite this focus on radiation genetics, Russia still seemed ill prepared for any practical applications when the Chernobyl disaster occurred in 1986. This was made clear to me in a recorded interview in 2005 with Gordon Laziuk, geneticist and paediatric pathologist in Minsk, who had established a congenital malformations register covering the affected region. (See www.genmedhist.org/interviews). Going at once to Chernobyl he found nothing but confusion and obstruction, as well as panic among the local population. The disaster had not been admitted until the radiation had spread beyond Russian borders; my translator for the interview commented to me that at his Moscow molecular genetics institute the first indication that there was any problem was when police came and removed all Geiger counters from the building! (Nikolai Yankowsky, personal communication 2005).\n                The suppression of Russian genetics extended beyond workers in the field to include those who attempted to record and chronicle this bizarre and tragic chapter. Foremost among these has been Zhores Medvedev (Fig. 9a), yet another colleague of Timoffef-Resovsky in Obninsk in the late 1960s and well established in the field of radiation genetics and cell aging. He had witnessed the earlier destruction of genetics as a young worker and decided to put as much as possible on the record, now that Stalin was dead and Lysenko disgraced. His book, The Rise and Fall of TD Lysenko [1], gives a largely first-hand account of events; it was circulated through the ‘Samizdat’ underground network, publication in Russia having been banned, and after its English translation appeared Medvedev was first imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital and then expelled while on a research visit to London, where he spent the rest of his career, and where I was able to interview him in 2006. Others attempting to chronicle the past events followed a similar fate, including Marc Popovsky, Valery Soyfer, and most notably and recently Raissa Berg (Fig. 9b), a former student of Hermann Muller in Russia; any attempt at criticism of the past, particularly in relation to human genetics, was forbidden up to around 1990, when Mikhail Gorbachev as President allowed the topic to be opened up, leading to the 2005 book of Babkov, The Dawn of Human Genetics, translated into English in 2013 [32]. Certainly the tensions were still palpable at the 1978 International Genetics Congress in Moscow, the eventual successor to the ill-fated and cancelled 1937 congress.\n                      \n                    Fig. 9\n                        Geneticists exiled from the Soviet Union for writing the truth about the destruction of Russian genetics included: a.

(Courtesy of Darhansoff Verrill Feldman literary agency).\n                      \n              Eastern Europe and Lysenkoist genetics\n                When the ‘iron curtain’ descended in 1945 to cut off the countries of Eastern Europe from the rest of the continent, Russian dominance also meant that Lysenkoist doctrines were imposed on geneticists, with traumatic results. Geneticists in Eastern Europe also became largely isolated from colleagues and research networks in the West, and many were dismissed or forbidden to teach. But some of these countries, notably Czechoslovakia, had a well-established, lengthy and proud tradition of classical genetics, beginning with Mendel himself, something that could not easily be eradicated. Also the isolation was never complete, especially in Germany, where Berlin initially provided a porous border between East and West and where even the communist authorities were far from convinced by Lysenko’s ideas. In East Germany a key figure was Hans Stubbe, a plant geneticist based in Halle, whose opposition was based on subversion rather than on direct resistance. Taking the line that Lysenko was bound to be correct but that more facts confirming his theories and disproving mendelian genetics were needed to convince the rest of the world, he and his colleagues repeated the experimental work under carefully controlled conditions. When the results turned out consistently to be the opposite of what was officially expected, this seriously undermined the standing and validity of Lysenkoist genetics. Stubbe’s key role is described by Rudolf Hagemann [13], who worked with him in Halle. In fact East Germany had quietly reverted to orthodox genetics some years before this occurred in Russia. In later years West German human geneticists made determined efforts to increase links, as Friedrich Vogel describes in his 2003 recorded interview with the author (www.genmedhist.org/interviews), in relation to the 1986 Berlin International Human Genetics Congress. A general account of the development of medical genetics and genetic counselling in the former East Germany has recently been given by Doetz [33].\n                In Czechoslovakia the process was more difficult, since Mendel, reviled as the origin of all matters relating to ‘capitalist genetics’, was still present in spirit in Brno; two interviews in my series, with medical geneticists Milan Macek (Prague) and Renata Laxova (Brno) illustrate some of the problems and tensions. Fortunately Lysenkoism had been abandoned shortly before the 1965 centenary of Mendel’s work, and the meeting to celebrate this in Brno [34] attracted many international geneticists who helped to restore the standing of Czechoslovak genetics.\n                The damaging effects of Russian influence extended beyond Europe and were marked in China, as already mentioned; here, no sooner had this problem been overcome than Chinese geneticists were subjected to the persecutions of the ‘cultural revolution’, which affected many of the older workers still active today. They were also much involved in the arguments surrounding the ‘maternal and child health law’, [35] originally termed the ‘eugenics law’, parts of which, notably the list in the initial version of proscribed disorders for reproduction, were very similar to the 1933 Nazi eugenics law. This law was eventually passed in 1986 in the face of opposition from many Chinese human geneticists and from international protests, but it was later largely abandoned, or at least not implemented. Understandably this remains a sensitive subject in China and the full story of the background and prolonged internal discussions has yet to be written, though I have tried to put together some fragments gleaned as a result of my own peripheral involvement [36]. Now that China has become a leading player in genomics and restrictions on writing about uncomfortable topics have been loosened to some extent, it is important that this chapter of events is fully documented and recognised, since most young workers in the field are unaware of it.\n                A word must be said here about how western geneticists reacted to Lysenkoism. Most were horrified and there were impassioned defences of Vavilov and other persecuted Russian geneticists. But those who were committed communists faced a dilemma in who to support. Muller, with first hand experience of the situation, immediately supported orthodox genetics, though his public stance was more guarded to protect his Russian former colleagues. Jacques Monod made an outspoken denunciation of Lysenko and left the French communist party. Others, not to their credit, were more ambivalent, notably JBS Haldane, while molecular scientist and crystallographer Desmond Bernal totally denied that there was any problem in accepting Lysenko’s views, despite the work of his close colleagues on the structure of DNA. Historian Diane Paul [37] has written a valuable article on the dilemmas faced by these Western workers in relation to Lysenkoism. This episode shows how for some scientists communism had assumed the status of a religion, where facts had little influence on entrenched belief.\n              The spread of human genetics across Europe and beyond\n                Restoration of progress in West European human genetics after the war was uneven but surprisingly rapid, with generous funding undoubtedly a factor in many countries. Centres such as London’s Galton Laboratory, with Lionel Penrose as head, acted as foci for training of people in the field and for more general influence, while others spent time at American centres, especially as medical genetics began to evolve from the basic science of human genetics. The patterns of development varied considerably between countries; thus in France, it was paediatricians who led the new field, its founders there, such as Robert Debré and Maurice Lamy, seeing that genetic disorders of childhood and congenital malformations were replacing infectious and nutritional diseases as the main causes of childhood mortality. In Britain a wider range of clinicians, from adult as well as paediatric backgrounds, became medical geneticists, a factor that helped to extend the scope of the field as specialists such as oncologists and neurologists became increasingly aware of genetic aspects and sought the help of medical geneticists. During the 1970s and 1980s most of the clinicians involved in the field became full time medical geneticists; defined training programmes were developed, while medical genetics itself became recognised as a distinct medical specialty in an increasing number of countries.\n                In 1967 the European Society of Human Genetics was founded and held its first meeting in Copenhagen; from the outset it was concerned to strengthen links among geneticists across the continent, especially with the recovering but still isolated workers in East Europe [38]. Its founders, notably Jan Mohr in Copenhagen, were keenly aware of the difficulties of their East European and Russian colleagues, and efforts to include them in meetings and later in collaborative studies proved an important factor in helping them rejoin the mainstream of human genetics.\n                Understandably the country for which human genetics has been and remains an especially sensitive and at times traumatic subject is Germany, in particular the former West Germany. This was aggravated by the post-war reappointment of a number of geneticists deeply complicit in the Nazi atrocities to important university positions, Otmar von Verschuer notable among them. These workers largely carried on with their previous research as if nothing had happened, as shown in the interviews in the book ‘Murderous Science’, by Benno Mueller-Hill [39], himself a bacterial geneticist, which led to considerable controversy and to the breaking away of most younger geneticists to form a new professional society. Petermann [40] has described the post-war development of human genetics across the Federal Republic of Germany.\n              Conclusion: Human and medical genetics today and in the future - still dangerous times?The beginning of the twentieth century saw the birth of modern genetics, and throughout the century dangers of one kind or another were closely associated with the new field, as we have seen. Will we see a continuation or repeat of these dangers across the world in the twenty-first century? While any attempt at prediction may be fruitless, we can at least try to identify those aspects of human genetics which might especially be associated with danger, and to recognise any potential warning signs. I shall try to do this here, though from the sidelines, as one no longer actively involved in clinical or research activity in the field, except from a historical perspective.First, one must recognise that the field of human genetics itself has changed radically since its emergence from more general genetics some 70 years ago. There is a much larger body of workers involved, spread more widely internationally, and with a much larger proportion involved with medical aspects of genetics.As Victor McKusick remarked in his 1975 address to the American Society of Human Genetics [41]:\n                  \n                    In the 1950s we heard some of our colleagues in biology bemoan the difficulties of stimulating interest in genetics on behalf of their medical school colleagues, and their complaints were well grounded in many instances. In the 1960s we heard some of them bemoan the taking over of the field by the medical school faculty. In the 1970s let us hope we are achieving a state of mutual respect and intimate collaboration between the two cultures.\n                  \n                This body of workers includes not only medical geneticists themselves but specific non-medical genetic counsellors, particularly in North America and UK; a high proportion of both categories are women, especially well placed to understand the practical and emotional issues related to genetic testing and the impact of inherited disease. Laboratory scientists include many diagnostic workers and researchers into genetic disorders, as well as those involved with the more basic aspects of human genetics.All this seems (and is) very different to the small groups of basic biologists who in the first half of the twentieth century were the self-appointed spokesmen on topics such as eugenics, and who discoursed on the supposed genetic problems associated with the poor, and with immigrant and minority ethnic groups.A second factor that is likely to be a powerful defence against the widespread misuse of genetics is the incorporation of strong ethical principles into the practice of both human genetics research and medical genetics practice. In part this can be seen as the application of the general principles that evolved as a reaction to the atrocities of world war 2, but it is also the result of the development of a strong ethical dimension within medical genetics itself, instilled initially by a small number of key founders such as Lionel Penrose in Britain and Arno Motulsky in America, and incorporated into the fabric of human and medical genetics generally as the field has developed.Finally, recent genomic research has increasingly shown that human populations are not only remarkably variable within themselves, but that supposedly different groups are for the most part remarkably similar genetically. Even with the worrisome rise of antagonism between different religious and social groups, there is no evidence that this is in any way mirrored by their genetic composition, while up to the present there have been few attempts to invoke or invent such genetic differences as possible factors in social conflicts. In contrast to the political involvement of the early twentieth century eugenicists, there are few or no geneticists now involved in making such claims.On the negative side, the greatly increased power of modern genetic techniques gives a potential for abuse that greatly exceeds what was available to the dictators and totalitarian societies of 70 years ago. Computerised DNA databases, predictive testing for late onset disorders, genetic screening and genome sequencing are all areas capable of abuse to a much greater extent than was the minimal and largely fallacious scientific underpinning of eugenics in the 1930s, while many politicians across the world now show at least as much disregard for the truth as at that time. New reproductive technologies continue to produce ethical dilemmas that have no easy answers, especially when linked to commercial pressures.Any optimistic conclusion to this article must therefore be tentative and cautious, given the numerous very real ethical issues and potential for abuse that do exist in the field of present day human genetics and genomics, both in research and in its applications. There are many political and other groups eager to misrepresent and distort sensitive advances, and it will require both vigilance from people in general and an active awareness and involvement of geneticists in the social consequences of new developments to ensure that this does not happen. Already there are early signs of such abuse, such as proposals for compulsory DNA testing of the entire population (Kuwait) and access to and use of genetic testing data by employers (USA).Apart from the united and immediate condemnation of these and other abuses by the genetics community that is essential, a continued strong ethical stance, transparency and good communication with the public, avoidance of false or exaggerated claims, the maintenance of close international links, and self-criticism within the human genetics community itself, are just some of the factors which we, as human geneticists, will need to ensure remain at the centre of our field, and are transmitted to the younger generations of workers.A vital part of this process is awareness of what has happened in the past, including both where human geneticists have failed in their responsibilities and where they have themselves suffered, sometimes at the cost of their lives, from their attempts to uphold the truth and an ethical approach to their research and practice. I hope that this article will contribute to such awareness world-wide, both among geneticists and among all those whose lives are affected in any way by the increasing applications of genetics to everybody.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsI thank the Mendelian Society of Lund, Sweden, the oldest society for genetics in the world (founded 1909), for the award of its 2017 Mendel medal and lecture, on which this article is partly based.

To understand the origin and evolution of Brassica amphidiploids, simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to unravel genetic variations in three diploids and three amphidiploid Brassica species of U’s triangle along with Eruca sativa as an outlier.\n              \n                Results\n                Of 124 Brassica-derived SSR loci assayed, 100% cross-transferability was obtained for B. juncea and three subspecies of B. rapa, while lowest cross-transferability (91.93%) was obtained for Eruca sativa. The average % age of cross-transferability across all the seven species was 98.15%. The number of alleles detected at each locus ranged from one to six with an average of 3.41 alleles per primer pair. Neighbor-Joining-based dendrogram divided all the 40 accessions into two main groups composed of B. juncea/B. nigra/B. rapa and B. carinata/B. napus/B. oleracea. C-genome of oilseed Brassica species remained relatively more conserved than A- and B-genome. A- genome present in B. juncea and B. napus seems distinct from each other and hence provides great opportunity for generating diversity through synthesizing amphidiploids from different sources of A- genome. B. juncea had least intra-specific distance indicating narrow genetic base. B. rapa appears to be more primitive species from which other two diploid species might have evolved.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                The SSR marker set developed in this study will assist in DNA fingerprinting of various Brassica species cultivars, evaluating the genetic diversity in Brassica germplasm, genome mapping and construction of linkage maps, gene tagging and various other genomics-related studies in Brassica species. Further, the evolutionary relationship established among various Brassica species would assist in formulating suitable breeding strategies for widening the genetic base of Brassica amphidiploids by exploiting the genetic diversity present in diploid progenitor gene pools.\n              Keywords\n                Brassica species\n              Cross-transferabilityEvolutionGenetic diversityGenomic-SSRsPhylogenetic analysisBackgroundPolyploidy is a widespread phenomenon among higher plants and is one of the major factors contributing to the structure and evolution of many crop species including Brassicas. Polyploidy is a natural hybridization process. The role played by hybridization had been debated for over a century and recent molecular genetic studies indicate that hybridization is amazingly occurring in natural population at a high frequency [1]. The reunion of genomes through hybridization and allopolyploidy has been estimated to account for 2–4% of speciation events in various flowering plants. Genus Brassica has a very long taxonomic and evolutionary history. It consists of three diploid species viz. B. rapa (2n =20, AA genome), B. nigra (2n = 16, BB genome), B. oleracea (2n = 18, CC genome) and three amphidiploid species viz. B. juncea (2n = 36, AABB genome), B. carinata (2n = 34, BBCC genome) and B. napus (2n = 38, AACC genome), all of which are cultivated forms, five are important oilseed crops, while B. oleracea is used as leafy vegetable. Among them, B. juncea (Indian mustard) represents the most common and widely cultivated oilseed crop, occupying >80% of rapeseed-mustard acreage in India. The relationship between the six major cultivated Brassica species was originally described by U [2], who associated the diploid Brassica species including B. rapa, B. nigra and B. oleracea with the amphidiploid B. juncea, B. carinata and B. napus (Fig. 1). B. juncea (AABB) is an amphidiploid containing diploid genomes from B. rapa (AA) and B. nigra (BB) [3]. B. napus (AACC) is a recent allotetraploid species, obtained as a result of spontaneous hybridization between the diploid species B. rapa (AA) and B. oleracea (CC). B. napus is an oilseed crop in many countries of Europe, Canada and Australia, and is used in industry as lubricant and biodiesel. B. carinata had been obtained by hybridization between B. nigra (BB) and B. oleracea (CC) and is cultivated in African countries. Since their parental genome species were thought to exist in diploid form and in different hemispheres, it became a hot research topic to explore the true progenitors for amphidiploid Brassica species. Further, it is also imperative to find out how their genome got modified during the course of evolutionary process.\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      U’s triangle showing genetic relationships between Brassica diploids and amphidiploids and the genetic distances based on SSR data\n                    To date, the molecular mechanism explaining the origin and evolution of rapeseed-mustard remains largely ambiguous. It is a pre-requisite to dissect the genetic relationships between these diploid and amphidiploids Brassica species. With the arrival of array of DNA-based markers, an impetus has been gained for more precise breeding, now known as molecular breeding, genetic diversity studies, phylogenetic analysis and to various crop improvement programmes [4]. However, except for B. oleracea and B. rapa, whose complete genomes have been sequenced, a very little genomic information is available for other members of Brassicaceae family, particularly for B. juncea, which is a very important oilseed crop in India, in which continuous efforts are being focused to improve several traits by exploring more number of markers, especially SSRs. The genomic evolution of Brassica allopolyploids (Chinese cultivars) had earlier been elucidated using ISSR markers [5]. However, due to lack of reproducibility and dominant nature of ISSR markers, SSR markers are the most preferred to study evolutionary process and genetic relationships. There are a number of advantages of using SSRs as they are co-dominant and multi-allelic in nature [6], offer less expensive PCR-based assay, scorability and high resolvability, and reproducibility, making them as an excellent marker system for determining phylogenetic relationships among closely related taxa.It has been found that the genetic material and its arrangement are highly conserved among closely related species and sequence homology is found among the SSR loci flanking regions of related species [7]. Due to the conserved nature of flanking sequences, SSR markers developed in one species can be employed to detect these microsatellite loci in other related species. Among Brassica species including B. rapa (AA), B. nigra (BB), B. napus (AACC) and B. oleracea (CC), large number of SSR markers have been developed and many of these markers have shown to be applicable within and between different Brassica species. In this study, we evaluated the variation in the patterns of Brassica-derived SSR marker amplification in terms of their cross-transferability and allelic variation across six Brassica species and one related genera, Eruca sativa, and inferred the origin and evolutionary history of Brassica amphidiploids. This work will demonstrate the feasibility of SSR markers in resolving phylogenetic relationships of Brassica species and elucidate the possible donor species of extant Brassica amphidiploids and will also unravel the genomic changes that have taken place during the process of evolution after the formation of amphidiploids. Further the large number of SSR markers, which are reported in this study showing cross-transferability and which can reveal the intra species variability, may be much useful in diversity analysis, making heterotic pools, gene tagging etc. in cultivated species like B. juncea, where the genomic resources are very meager to carry out such studies.MethodsPlant materials\n                Forty genotypes including 36 belonging to six Brassica species (3 amphidiploids; B. juncea, B. carinata and B. napus, and 3 diploids including B. nigra, B. rapa and B. oleracea) and 4 of Eruca sativa as an outlier, were used in the present study. Eruca sativa genotypes were included because of its known distant relationship to the Brassica species complex. The details about their ploidy level and genomic constitution are mentioned in Table 1. Actively growing shoot and leaf samples from all the forty genotypes were harvested and stored at -80 °C in the deep freezer.Table 1\n                        List of Brassica and related species used in the present study\n                      Sr. no.SpeciesGenotype/cultivarPloidy levelGenome constitution1.\n                              B. nigra\n                            IC 2628922×BBIC 5606972×BBIC 5607022×BBIC 5607132×BB2.\n                              B. juncea\n                            DRMRIJ 314×AABBRohini4×AABBNRCHB 1014×AABBNRCDR 24×AABBKranti4×AABBPusaBold4×AABB3.\n                                            B. rapa ssp. toria\n                                          Agrani2×AABhawani2×AAParwati2×AAPT 3032×AAssp.

The quality of the extracted DNA was evaluated by determination of A260/A280 absorbance ratio by spectrophotometer (UV-Visible Elico spectrophotometer). DNA concentration and purity were estimated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. A portion of DNA was diluted in molecular grade water to a concentration of 10 ng/µl and stored at -20 °C.\n              Microsatellite markers and PCR analysis\n                SSR markers (124 primer pairs) derived from B. nigra, B. rapa, B. napus and B. oleracea were custom synthesized. Primer sequences for majority of SSR markers were obtained from http://www.brassica.info and Xu et al. [9]. B. nigra (BB-genome) specific SSRs were provided by Dr. S.S. Banga, National Professor (Plant Breeding & Genetics), ICAR, PAU, Ludhiana, Punjab through personal communication.\n                For SSR genotyping, the genomic DNA was amplified in a 25 µl reaction volume containing 50 ng DNA, 1X PCR buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 2.0 mM Mgcl2, 1.0 U Taq polymerase (MBI Fermentas, USA) and 400 nM primer using a thermal cycler (Verity 96-w Thermal Cycler, ABI, USA). The first amplification cycle consisted of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles each of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 55 °C - 60 °C (varying with primer pair) for 30 s, primer extension at 72 °C for 45 s and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. The annealing temperature (Ta) was kept 2–3 °C below the melting temperature (Tm) of that particular primer sequence. PCR amplified products were electrophoretically separated on 3.5% MetaPhor agarose gel containing 0.01% ethidium bromide-, prepared in 1xTAE (Tris-Acetic acid-EDTA) using 50 bp DNA ladder (Thermo Scientific, USA) as a standard reference. After electrophoresis, the amplification products were visualized in a gel documentation system fitted with 8 b CCD camera and UV light (Syngene Gel Doc, Syngene, Synoptic Ltd., UK). At least, two independent PCR amplifications were performed for each marker.\n              Data analysis\n                Cross-transferability was determined from the presence or absence of bands on agarose gels. Each sample was assigned a ‘1’ if a band or bands was present and a ‘0’ for no band. PCR amplicons were classified into four groups on the basis of signal intensity as earlier described [10, 11]; a) strong intensity and easily scorable, b) weaker intensity and scorable, c) very week intensity and difficult to score, and d) no signal at all. Amplicons belonging to classes a) and b) were considered for positive amplification, while those belonging to classes c) and d) were considered negative for amplification and thus ignored. To determine positive amplification of a SSR marker in a species, atleast 75% of the genotypes of that species must show amplification. Cross-transferability of all the SSR markers in a species was calculated as the percentage of amplified SSRs in that species. The number of total alleles detected in all the Brassica species under study were determined for each SSR locus. The polymorphic information content (PIC) value of each SSR marker was calculated [12] using the formula; PIC = 1- S(Pi)2, where Pi is the frequency of the ith allele calculated for each SSR marker.\n                Further, data were scored based on the presence or absence of bands, generating a binary data matrix of 1 and 0 for each marker system and were analyzed using the DARwin 5 software [13]. The data matrices were used to calculate genetic similarity based on Jaccard’s similarity coefficient [14] and dendrogram displaying relationships among 40 genotypes was constructed by Neighbor-Joining method [15]. Intra and interspecies distances were estimated as mean of distances between n (n-1)/2 and n1 x n2 genotypes respectively, where n is the number of genotypes in a species.\n              Results and discussionSSR marker variability/transferability across Brassica species\n                Of the 124 Brassica-derived SSR loci assayed, 100% cross-transferability had been obtained for B. juncea and all three subspecies of B. rapa, while the lowest cross-transferability (91.93%) was obtained for Eruca sativa, where 114 SSRs showed successful amplification (Fig. 2, Additional file 1: Table S1). Out of 124 SSR markers evaluated, 114 SSRs were found to be cross-transferable across all the species under study, which infers that those SSR sites are already present / conserved in all the genotypes, indicating genome similarity and close relationship among these species. A total of 107 SSRs resulted into polymorphic amplicons. The average % age of cross amplification across all the seven species was 98.15%. The number of alleles detected at each locus ranged from one to six with an average of 3.41 alleles per primer, with a size range of 50–500 bp, which reflects huge variation among repeat regions of different alleles (Table 2). The polymorphic information content (PIC) value ranged from 0.04 (SJ1536 & BrgMS432) to 0.81 (Ol10B11 & BrgMS338). The highest average number of alleles was obtained in B. napus (1.91), while the lowest average number of alleles per primer pair (1.47) was found in B. rapa subspecies yellow sarson (Additional file 2: Table S2).

Recently, comparative genomics in Brassica have shown that microsatellite characteristics in related species are highly similar [17]. Intra-generic transferability of SSRs had been reported earlier in many studies, eg. SSRs from Pennisetum glaucum to P. purpureum [18], Brassica species to B. tournefortii, B. fruticulosa and B. spinescens [19]. However, transferability of SSR markers to distantly related species has also been reported [20]. Transferability and polymorphic potential of various Brassica-derived SSR markers among Brassica species had also been investigated earlier [21, 22]. In another study, transferability of SSR markers between A- and C- genomes of Brassica species had been evaluated [23], which corresponded to the already established evolutionary relationship. However, we are reporting here a new set of SSR markers in addition to the already validated SSRs in different genotypes of Brassica species, which would be helpful in Brassica genomics studies, particularly for B. juncea, where very little genomic information is available.\n              Phylogenetic relationship between diploid and amphidiploids species\n                In order to establish a clear basis for establishing the origin of Brassica ampidiploids, we used SSR markers to provide baseline evidence to clarify the possible origins of various species. The NJ-based dendrogram divided all the 40 accessions into two main groups, respectively composed of B. juncea/B. nigra/B. rapa (ssp. yellow sarson, toria and brown sarson) i.e. AB- genome, B- and A- genome species; and B. carinata/B. napus/B. oleracea var. capitata and botrytis i.e. BC-, AC- and C- genome species (Fig. 3). Species comprising of A- and B- genome has fallen in different groups, while all the species having C genome grouped together. It clearly demonstrates that A- and B- genomes of oilseed Brassica species have undergone more genomic changes than C- genome after amphidiploidization and intensive cultivation. Though B. oleracea, a vegetable species has worldwide distribution, yet C- genome present in oilseed Brassica species B. carinata and B. napus remained conserved, hence there is a need to introgress C- genome from different sources to create more diversity in these species. Grouping of B. juncea (AABB) and B. napus (AACC) into two different groups in the present study is an indication of diversity between A- genome of both species. A recent study reported that A- genome of B. juncea and B. napus each had independent origins [24] and this information may shed light on the unusual features of selection divergence in Brassica. Thus introgression of individual A-genome types may be carried out to synthesize Brassica amphidiploids to achieve more diversity for breeding objectives.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Unweighted Neighbor-Joining (UNJ) dendrogram depicting the genetic relationship among different species of Brassicaceae based on allelic data of SSR markers\n                      \n                Intra-species distance was highest in B. oleracea followed by B. rapa (Table 3). Both species comprise of subspecies indicating much variability within these species. Least intra-species distance was observed in B. juncea depicting its narrow genetic base. B. oleracea and B. rapa are grown worldwide over wide geographic ranges, therefore have accumulated more diversity; while B. juncea is mostly restricted to south Asia and that is the reason behind its narrow genetic variability [25]. Interspecies distances throw light on their contribution in evolutionary process. Highest interspecies distance was found between B. carinata (BBCC) and E. sativa (EE) indicating relatively low exchange of genetic material between these two species, hence these are the most unrelated ancestors. It was quite interesting to note that among three amphidiploids, B. carinata and B. napus had highest genetic distance with E. sativa, while B. juncea had more distance with B. oleracea than E. sativa. It indicates the possibility of exchanging genetic material between B. juncea and E. sativa more frequently than between B. oleracea/B. napus and E. sativa.Table 3\n                        Genetic distances between different species of Brassicacaeae under present investigation\n                       \n                              B. nigra\n                            \n                              B. juncea\n                            \n                              B. rapa\n                            \n                              B. napus\n                            \n                              B. carinata\n                            \n                              Eruca sativa\n                            \n                              B. oleracea\n                              \n                                            ssp. toria\n                                          \n                              ssp. yellow sarson\n                            \n                              ssp. brown sarson\n                               var. botrytis\n                                          var. capitata\n                                          \n                              B. nigra\n                            0.191         \n                              B. juncea\n                            0.3590.132        \n                              B. rapa ssp. toria\n                            0.5390.4880.133       \n                              B. rapa ssp. yellow sarson\n                            0.5580.4810.3380.171      \n                              B. rapa ssp. brown sarson\n                            0.5560.5090.3630.4290.351     \n                              B. napus\n                            0.6070.5890.5670.5770.5530.206    \n                              B. carinata\n                            0.5860.5830.5790.5690.5990.6220.184   \n                              Eruca sativa\n                            0.5850.5830.5790.5690.5990.6220.6930.184  \n                                            B. oleracea var. botrytis\n                                          0.6610.6380.6170.5920.6240.5530.5680.6030.203 \n                                            B. oleracea var. capitata\n                                          0.6620.6430.6150.5960.61640.5450.5740.5920.3870.347\n                \n                           B. juncea was closer to B. nigra (BB) than B. rapa (AA) which suggests exchange of genetic information between these two species through natural hybridization during evolution. It had been reported that B. juncea might have originated several times with both B. rapa and B. nigra as cytoplasmic donors in separate hybridization events [26]. B. napus had almost equal genetic distance with its ancestors B. oleracea (CC, 0.551) and B. rapa (AA, 0.568). More extensive breeding programmes in B. napus have resulted into introgression of both AA and CC genomes equally. Another study ruled out the possibilities of any close relationship of B. oleracea (CC) or any of the C-genomes species with the maternal progenitor of B. napus (AACC) using chloroplast and nuclear-SSR markers [27]. They also proposed that multiple hybridization events involving different maternal ancestors might have produced B. napus. In a previous study, a fully resolved chloroplast phylogeny of various Brassica crops and wild relatives (from USA) had been established using four plastid region based markers [28], where various Brassica species were placed in either of the two most species-rich clades i.E. nigra and Oleracea. They grouped E. sativa, B. napus, B. juncea, B. rapa and B. oleracea into Oleracea clade, while B. nigra and B. carinata were placed into Nigra clade. Highest interspecies distance between E. sativa and B. carinata in our nuclear genome based study is in conformity with the grouping of these two species in different clades based on plastid genome based study, but differs for grouping of B. oleracea which might have happened due to the exchange of nuclear genome between B. carinata and B. oleracea in recent breeding programmes.\n                Similarly B. carinata also has equal distances with B. nigra (BB, 0.564) and B. oleracea (CC, 0.570). Among the A-, B- and C- genome; A- was nearer to B- (0.552) than C- (0.608), while B- and C- were at farthest distance (0.661). It would have been due to different regions of their cultivation. On the basis of genetic distances between diploid species, we propose B. rapa as the most primitive ancestor of U’s triangle which would have undergone changes to evolve other two diploid species. Further insight was sought to look into three subtypes of B. rapa viz. toria, yellow sarson and brown sarson. Toria subtype was nearer to yellow sarson than brown sarson, while yellow sarson and brown sarson were at relatively more genetic distance. Among the three subtypes of B. rapa, toria has been derived from brown sarson through selection for earliness to fit well in the cropping systems. B. rapa var. brown sarson seems to be the primitive ancestor of all diploid species. Yellow sarson is characterized by yellow seed coat color, tetralocular siliquae, semi-erect plant type and self-mating system, while brown sarson encompasses two different forms lotni (cross-pollinated) and tora (self-pollinated), brown seed coat color and bilocular siliquae. Yellow sarson which is closely related with brown sarson would have evolved as mutant of brown sarson. However, the peroximity of toria with yellow sarson in the present study would have been due to winter type brown sarson varieties. A similar study revealed the phylogenetic relationships among cultivated B. rapa ssp. rapa, ssp. oleifera, ssp. pekinensis, ssp. chinensis and ssp. japonica using AFLP markers and concluded that B. rapa cultivars from east Asia were probably derived from a primitive cultivated type, which might have originated in Europe or in central Asia and then migrated to east Asia [29].\n                Molecular markers are excellent tools to study the genetic relationships and genomic evolution of polyploid species. Genetic relationships among Brassica species (Indian genotypes) as depicted by SSR markers in the present investigation were in agreement with the diploid/amphidiploids relationship as described by U [2]. It may be inferred that the ancient amphidiploid Brassica species were formed possibly by hybridization and chromosome doubling between archaic species related to B. rapa, B. nigra, B. oleracea.\n              ConclusionIn conclusion, the high level of SSR marker cross-transferability observed in this study demonstrated the usefulness of various Brassica-derived SSR markers for the analysis of genetic relationship and provided insights into the genomic evolution of various diploid and amphidiploids Brassica species. This SSR marker set will assist in DNA fingerprinting of various Brassica species cultivars, evaluating the genetic diversity in Brassica germplasm, genome mapping and construction of linkage maps, gene tagging and various other genomics-related studies in Brassica species. This research investigation has attempted to find out the diploid progenitors of various Brassica amphidiploids. C-genome of oilseed Brassica species remained relatively more conserved than A- and B-genome. A- genome present in B. juncea and B. napus seems distinct from each other and hence provides great opportunity for generating diversity through synthesizing amphidiploids from different sources of A- genome. B. juncea had least intra-specific distance indicating narrow genetic base. B. rapa appears to be more primitive species from which other two diploid species might have evolved. Among three subtypes of B. rapa, brown sarson appeared the most primitive progenitor. Eruca sativa was found to be closer to B. juncea than B. carinata and B. napus. Suitable breeding strategies can be formulated for widening the genetic base of Brassica amphidiploids by exploiting the genetic diversity present in diploid progenitor gene pools (A-, B- & C-).Abbreviations\n                AFLP: \n                    Amplified fragment length polymorphism\n                  CTAB: \n                    Cetyl tri-ammonium bromide\n                  ISSR: \n                    Inter simple sequence repeat\n                  NJ: \n                    Neighbor-Joining\n                  PCR: \n                    Polymerase chain reaction\n                  RAPD: \n                    Random amplified polymorphic DNA\n                  RFLP: \n                    Restriction fragment length polymorphism\n                  SSR: \n                    Simple sequence repeat\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThe authors wish to acknowledge the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of India for providing financial support in the form of Research Grant under the scheme ‘Start-up Research Grant for Young Scientists’ (Grant No. SB/YS/LS-86/2014).\n                Availability of data and materials\n                Not applicable.\n              Authors’ contributionsAll the authors have equally contributed towards this manuscript.

Recent researches indicated that the CACNA1I involved in calcium channels probably affect the potential pathogenesis of SCZ.\n              \n                Results\n                In this study, we attempted to investigate whether the CACNA1I gene contributes the risk to SCZ in the Uighur Chinese population, and performed a case-control study involving 985 patient samples and 1218 normal controls to analyze nine SNPs within the CACNA1I gene. Among these sites, six SNPs were significantly associated with SCZ in the allele distribution: rs132575 (adjusted P\n                           allele\n                   = 0.039, OR = 1.159), rs713860 (adjusted P\n                           allele\n                   = 0.039, OR = 0.792), rs738168 (adjusted P\n                           allele\n                   = 0.039, OR = 0.785), rs136805 (adjusted P\n                           allele\n                   = 0.014, OR = 1.212), rs5757760 (adjusted P\n                           allele\n                   = 0.042, OR = 0.873) and rs5750871 (adjusted P\n                           allele\n                   = 0.039, OR = 0.859). In addition, two SNPs turned to be risk factors for SCZ not only in the allele distribution, but also in the genotype distribution: rs132575 (adjusted P\n                           genotype\n                   = 0.037) and rs136805 (adjusted P\n                           genotype\n                   = 0.037).\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Overall, the present study provided evidence that significant association exists between the CACNA1I gene and SCZ in the Uighur Chinese population, subsequent validation of functional analysis and genetic association studies are needed to further extend this study.\n              KeywordsSchizophrenia, CACNA1I gene, Case-control study, Uighur ChineseBackgroundSchizophrenia (SCZ) is one of enigmatic, complex psychotic mental disease that characterized by abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality, causing a substantial burden on patients and public expenditure [1, 2]. The lifetime prevalence of SCZ is generally estimated to be 1%, and genetic risks account for up to 80% occurrences [3]. This chronic disorder poses series of typical manifestations resembling auditory hallucinations, delusions, and behavioral dysfunction [4, 5]. A lot of crucial developments in neuropathology, epidemiology, and medications are emerged, triggering better identification of etiology and effective therapeutics. Analysis of the genetic epidemiologic in family, twin, and adoption, the conclusion suggest that hereditary loci for which linkage to the SCZ play a critical role in the development of the disease [6].With the deepening research of gene detection and disease mechanism, CACNA1I (calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 I) has been identified as a candidate gene for SCZ. Recently, a primary GWAS conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium-Schizophrenia Workgroup (PGC-SCZ) has made encouraging progress in identifying genetic susceptibility loci, and the CACNA1I gene is reported as a new locus for SCZ in Caucasian [7]. CACNA1I is located at 22p13.1, spanning about 118 kb genomic region, and consists of 38 exons. This gene encodes Cav3.3 isoform that contains a pore-forming alpha subunit, and the coding product of CACNA1I is a member of low-threshold (T-type) Ca2+ channels [8, 9]. The CACNA1I gene is abundantly expressed in the thalamic reticular nucleus, and delineates the distinctive physiological properties of neuronal firing [10, 11]. There are three subtypes of low threshold voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels have been implicated and designated a1G (Cav3.1), a1H (Cav3.2) and a1I (Cav3.3) by previous reports, which endow typical kinetic features and involve in different signatures of T-currents, respectively [12]. In view of the exploration of the thalamic reticular and relay neurons activities, increasing results point to Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 channels represent short burst firing and small conductance, while Cav3.3 leads to slower activation and inactivation [13, 14].The normal physiological activities of human beings need to be maintained through the action potential discharge of specific ion channels. Ion exchange is responsible for the level of intracellular Ca2+, carry out a series of electrical, chemical, and physical function [15]. Evidence demonstrates that CACNA1I mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in brain regions, and Cav3.3 channel provoked by small membrane depolarization can elicit spontaneous discharge. The channel encoded by CACNA1I plays a central role in the thalamic spindle generator [16], alongside reduced sleep spindles associate with SCZ [17]. Abnormalities of sleep spindles and disturbances in thalamic neurons, are found in people with schizophrenia. It is noteworthy that the encode proteins has been reported can meet the druggable target of SCZ [18]. Moreover, T-type calcium channels have been shown to be a crucial cause of insomnia and neuropathic pain [19]. There is evidence that a single copy of Chr22:39665939G > A CACNA1I triggers calcium channel disorder and is associated with the pathogenesis of SCZ [20]. These profound findings have prompted us to open up promising research idea that CACNA1I might regulates signaling pathways in SCZ.Uygur is one of the minority nationalities in China, and mainly distributes in Xinjiang Province. The region located in the northwest border area of China, and the hinterland of the Eurasian continent. As a part of the ancient Silk Road, the mutual migration between the countries, the typical diets, and the different lifestyles play the important role in shaping the genetic structure [21, 22]. The Uygur populations therefore are results of admixture of Han Chinese and Western Europe [23], and also is the highlight of the current study.To date, there have been no studies that CACNA1I SNPs association with SCZ in the Uygur Chinese population reported, so it is the first study which performed CACNA1I in the Uygur Chinese population. A total of nine SNPs were selected in CACNA1I, including eight tag SNPs which were examined to provide a good coverage of this region, and one positive SNP which identified from a genome-wide association study was selected [24].MethodsSubjects\n                In total, 985 unrelated patients with SCZ (612 males and 373 females), and 1218 control individuals (629 males and 589 females) were enrolled from Xinjiang Province. The mean age of SCZ cases was 39.45 years (±12.12), and normal controls was 43.07 years (±13.14). The data was illustrated as Table 1.Table 1\n                        Demographic detail of sample set\n                       Patients with schizophreniaHealthy controlsTotal sample(N)9851218MaleFemaleMaleFemale612373629589Mean age ± SD39.45 ± 12.1243.07 ± 13.14\n                All eligible subjects selected were the native population of Xinjiang province. Clinical diagnosis were carried out in strict accordance with DSM-IV criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the fourth edition) based on SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders) by interviewed with two independent psychiatrists. The healthy controls were randomly selected from the general Uighur population. All participants signed informed consent. This study obtained the consent of the local ethnic ethics, and undertaken the support of its support.\n              Genomic assay\n                According to QuickGene DNA whole blood kit L (FUJIFILM), genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of the subjects. Eight tag SNPs (rs132567, rs738168, rs713860, rs11705208, rs132575, rs136805, rs5757760, rs5750871) are obtained through Haploview software version 4.2, with pair-wise r2\n                   threshold =0.5 and minor allele frequency = 0.05 [25]. Besides, we put a positive site of the previous research (rs9607658) into the experiment. The specific information of these 9 SNPs is listed in Table 2, while, the nine SNPs in the relative position of CACNA1I gene is also shown in Fig. 1. All samples were subjected to genotyping by the Sequenom MassARRAY matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry platform (Sequenom Inc., San Diego, CA).Table 2\n                        The information of 9 SNPs in CACNA1I gene\n                      SNP IDrs9607658rs132567rs132575rs713860rs738168rs136805rs11705208rs5757760rs5750871Position39,561,73539,577,52139,586,71639,612,82139,615,69239,622,20739,646,04839,648,39739,673,444FunctionintronintronintronintronintronintronintronintronintronPolymorphismC/TA/GC/TC/TA/GC/TC/TC/TA/G\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Relative positions in gene CACNA1I of nine SNPs\n                      \n              Statistical analysis\n                Powerful SHEsis software provides a set of processing parameters for maximum benefit, including allele and genotype frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, association tests and haplotype analysis (http://shesisplus.bio-x.cn/SHEsis.html) [26, 27]. This is a comprehensive platform for processing association study, and perform expectation maximization algorithm in haplotype reconstruction and frequency estimation. Allele and genotype frequencies refer to the percentage of allele and genotype in a population, and show the diversity and abundance of the gene in a population. FDR correction is a conservative method to explain multiple comparisons. All outputted tests were two-tailed, the P value standard of the statistical significance were set to be less than 0.05.\n              ResultsSingle site analysis\n                The genotype P values of the 9 SNPs in Hard–Weinberg equilibrium test (HWE) were all larger than 0.05 in both patients and healthy controls. So they all did not deviate from Hard–Weinberg equilibrium, and demonstrated the genetic properties of this sample population remained relatively stable.

SCZ is highly heritable, and the genes that contribute to the disorder play an important role [28]. In this context, we have attempted to confirm an association of CACNA1I variants with SCZ. We discovered nine variation sites within the CACNA1I locus, as well as one previously studied by Aiden Corvin et al. [24]. This is first study which replicated genetic susceptibility of CACNA1I gene in the Uygur Chinese population.We found nominally association between several SNPs of CACNA1I and SCZ. There are four SNPs, rs713860, rs738168, rs5757760 and rs5750871 identified to be associated with SCZ in the allele distributions. In addition, both rs132575 and rs136805 were found to be significantly associated in allelic and genotype analysis. Before FDR correction, rs738168 was associated with schizophrenia in the genotype distribution. Most of the investigated SNPs were positive in our subjects.rs9607658 was reported as a risk factor for SCZ in population of Ireland in a genome–wide association study (GWAS) by Aiden Corvin et al. (combined P = 3.3 × 10-5, OR[95% CI] = 1.21[1.10–1.33]) [24]. However, rs9607658 did not confer susceptibility in the present study (adjusted P = 0.142, OR[95% CI] = 1.101[0.968–1.253]). This is likely to be caused by racial differences between Uygur and Ireland populations, and the existence of genetic heterogeneity can lead to such a result. A study on Uygur genetic characteristics suggest Uygur population from northern and southern Xinjiang Province share different proportions of ancestors from the European and Han population, so they are the results of admixture the anthropological features of the East and West [29, 30]. The minor allele frequency (MAF = T) in the Han Chinese population is 0.03, whereas in the Ireland population it is 0.54. The results of these two different populations are profound discrepancy, and Uighur population as mixture of the European and Han population also produce certain differences in MAF. Besides, the accuracy of the result is related to the sample size, and the small sample size in this study is used as a limitation for the significant analysis.In addition, the result has been adopted segregation analysis of sex as a research strategy. We found that male had more susceptibility loci for SCZ, but all the SNPs were negative in the female group. This may be due to a difference in the prevalence and symptoms of psychiatric disorders from a gender standpoint. Previous literature also shows that the existence of significant gender differences in animal models of mental illness [31]. Compared with women SCZ patients, men with SCZ have a high rate of mortality (death, suicide) and earlier onset in the study of gender differences by Mao-Sheng Ran et al. [32]. For the present study, a total of 373 women in the patient sample, 589 women were recruited in the control group. Sample size is a critical factor in gender analysis, thus, there is a need for a larger sample to validate the association between gender and SCZ.Although these nine SNPs are located in the intron region of CACNA1I gene, and they are not directly involved in the biological functions and characteristics of T-type calcium channel, intronic variations may provide some auxiliary cis-acting elements for gene expression regulation, which plays a role in modifying gene transcription efficiency. The protein encoded by CACNA1I is widely expressed in the nucleus reticularis thalami, different splice variants can affect the normal discharge of neurons [33]. Besides, we evaluated the protein interaction of CACNA1I gene by the version 10.0 of STRING [34], the result showed the CACNB2 gene involved in SCZ interacts with CACNA1I gene, Whether different splice variants or protein-protein interactions, they may confers risk for SCZ.The CACNA1I gene encodes the alpha-1 subunit of the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav3.3, presenting series of function of calcium ion channel that are involved in the neural development and synapse formation [35]. Gene related to Ca2+ signaling, such as CACNA1I that encode VGCC subunits is associated with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders [36]. Evidence suggested that this gene is significantly associated with psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders. rs5750860, located in CACNA1I, has been reported to be associated with autism spectrum disorders by using existing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and imputation methods [37] . Previous study indicated CACNA1I plays a crucial role in spindle activity by participating in the synchronous oscillation of thalamic cortical neurons, and expected to serve as a novel treatment biomarker associated with impaired cognition for individuals with SCZ by treating spindle deficits [17]. The release of neurotransmitters involved in the pathological process of SCZ, and simultaneously there is the research indicated that the CACNA1I gene triggers synaptic plasticity in reticular thalamic neurons. Presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic receptor signal transduction play an important role in the transmission of information in the brain [38].ConclusionFor this study, our efforts on mental illness represent a promising beginning. This is the first time that genetic factors of the CACNA1I gene have been verified to be associated with SCZ in the Uygur Chinese population. Obviously, CACNA1I plays a key role in the pathogenesis of SCZ. However, the present study remains a major bottleneck in the validation of larger samples, and a larger sample size could be better demonstrate the role of the CACNA1I gene in the etiology of schizophrenia. In addition, the Uighur Chinese population has been verified in the present study, and genetic association of other ethnic groups are suggested. Further functional studies of the CACNA1I gene are encouraged to conduct, especially in other ethnic groups. All the analysis will facilitate new therapeutic route for SCZ and may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of psychiatric illnesses.Abbreviations\n                \n                    CACNA1I\n                  : \n                    Calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 I\n                  DSM-IV: \n                    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the fourth edition\n                  GWAS: \n                    Genome wide association study\n                  HWE: \n                    Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test\n                  LD: \n                    Linkage disequilibrium; OR, odds ratio\n                  MALDI-TOF: \n                    Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight\n                  PGC-SCZ: \n                    Psychiatric Genomics Consortium -Schizophrenia Workgroup\n                  SCID-I: \n                    Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders\n                  SCZ: \n                    Schizophrenia\n                  Declarations\n                Funding\n                We are deeply grateful to all the participants in the study.

In this study, we investigated the gene expression profile in OA by microarray analysis.\n              \n                Results\n                Histopathological characteristics of OA cartilage were examined using a rat model of leptin-induced OA. Gene expression profile of leptin-induced articular cartilage and healthy rat cartilage were compared using genome-wide microarray hybridization. A total of 1857 genes differentially expressed genes (1197 upregulated and 660 downregulated) were identified, some of which are known to be associated with leptin-induced OA phenotype. These included genes related to MMPs, inflammatory factors, growth factors, apoptotic genes and osteogenic genes. In addition, upregulated expressions of some new candidate genes, which have hitherto fore not been linked to OA (such as BCL2L11) were detected in leptin-induced OA cartilage, which suggests that these genes might be important for OA molecular mechanism.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Our findings suggest that pathogenesis of leptin-induced OA involves modulation of expression of multiple genes, although the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be studied further. Further investigation of leptin-induced gene expression changes is needed to gain new insights into the molecular mechanism of OA pathogenesis.\n              KeywordsOsteoarthritisLeptinRatsDEGBackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders and is the most common form of arthritis among the elderly population [1]. Multiple factors are involved in the onset and progression of OA. Among the OA phenotypes associated with joint failure, such as malalignment, muscle dysfunction, ligament tear, subchondral bone sclerosis and osteophyte growth, cartilage degradation is the most common phenotype [2]. Chondrocytes, which is the only cell type in healthy cartilage tissue, are critical for remodeling and maintenance of the structure and function of the cartilaginous extracellular matrix. Over the last few years, chondrocyte apoptosis and the related signaling pathways have evoked much interest, since it is considered to be the leading mechanism of cartilage degradation in OA joint [3–5]. Although the underlying mechanisms involved in pathological progression has remained elusive, inhibition of chondrocyte death has been suggested as a therapeutic target for limiting cartilage degradation. Furthermore, inflammation is believed to play a critical role in the onset of OA due to its catabolic effect on cartilage [6]. Systemic and local production of inflammatory cytokines, activation of complement and innate immune response are shown to be important in the progression of OA.Obesity has been traditionally considered as a local risk factor for OA due to increased mechanical load on weight-bearing joints such as knees and hips [7]. But the fact that obese individuals are also at a higher risk of OA in non-weight-bearing joints such as hands, wrists and shoulders [8] suggests that additional factors related to obesity may also play a role in the onset and progression of OA. It has been reported that leptin, which is produced predominantly in white adipose tissue, shows significantly higher levels in synovial fluid of patients with OA as compared to that in healthy individuals. This leads us to an epidemiological link between OA and leptin [9, 10]. Since functional leptin receptor is found on healthy chondrocytes [11], it is believed that leptin/leptin receptor signaling axis may modulate synovial joint homeostasis. During OA progression, excessive concentration of leptin may induce metabolic changes in chondrocytes. Moreover, leptin has also been reported to modulate inflammatory factors and catabolic enzymes in cartilage and other joint tissues [12]. Simopoulou et al. reported that leptin inhibited chondrocyte proliferation and increased IL-1ß, MMP-9 and MMP-13 secretion to the synovial fluid. Insights gained from these studies indicate a temporal relationship of leptin with onset as well as progression of OA. Since leptin is a catabolic factor in cartilage metabolism and could be a driving factor in the pathogenesis of OA, intra-articular injection of leptin has been used to establish a rat model of OA [13].High through-put gene expression studies such as microarray analyses are increasingly used to identify changes in gene expression profiles during the onset and progression of complex diseases such as OA. Further, these have also been used to identify biomarkers to aid diagnosis as well as to monitor disease activity and therapeutic response [14, 15]. Several microarray studies have recently been performed to study OA related gene expression, with a focus on cartilage of OA patients [16–20]. These findings can help understand the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in progression of arthritis. However, innate differences between patients, such as with respect to age, and stratification of joints, tend to introduce an element of bias. Therefore, assessment of gene expression changes in response to external stimuli, such as leptin, may provide new insights into the genetic determinants of OA and the signaling pathways involved in its pathogenesis.In this study, we integrated microarray data from articular chondrocytes of rats and sought to identify gene expression profiles and signaling pathways that can mark the pathogenetic changes in OA cartilage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform microarray analyses to compare healthy cartilage and leptin-stimulated cartilage, thereby providing clues to the pathogenetic mechanisms of OA. The results of this study could help identify new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.MethodsExperimental animals\n                Male Sprague–Dawley (160–180 g) rats (age, 6 weeks) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Shanghai, China). All experiments involving use of live animals were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals had ad libitum access to water and food. Before the experiment, all rats were acclimatized for 6 days in the facility.\n                Rats were randomly divided into two groups: control (n = 12) and leptin-induced (n = 12). Before injection, all rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. Rats in the control group were administered 50 µL sterile saline solution into the right knee joint. Rats in the leptin-induced group were administered rat recombinant leptin (100 µg) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) into the right knee joint. Forty eight hours after injection, six rats from each group were euthanized for RNA extraction. The cartilage of knee joint was collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen [21], and stored at -80 °C in an ultra-low temperature freezer until further use. The remaining six rats were kept alive until 4 or 8 weeks post-injection for histological examination.\n              Histological examination\n                Three rats from each group were euthanized at 4 weeks post- injection while the last 3 rats from each group were euthanized at 8 weeks post-injection. Right knee joints of rats were harvested. After fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, all samples were immerged in hydrochloric acid solution for 24 h for decalcification. The decalcified tissues were subjected to sequential dehydration in a graded alcohol series, paraffin-embedded, and 5-µm sections prepared with a microtome. The sections were stained with Safranin O and independently examined by two pathologists. OARSI score was obtained to evaluate the severity of osteoarthritis [22].\n              RNA extraction\n                Cartilage from the two groups of rats was harvested in RNase-free conditions immediately after euthanasia, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C in an ultra-low temperature freezer. Total RNA was extracted with use of Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Germany). The RNA concentration was measured by a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher, USA). RNA integrity was assessed with Agilent 2100 Bio-analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).\n              Microarray hybridization and data analysis\n                Microarray hybridization was performed as described elsewhere [23]. Briefly, the Cy3-labeled cRNA with whole rat Genome oligo Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was hybridized using the Gene Expression Hybridization Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) in a hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies). Raw data were obtained and normalized by the Quantile algorithm, Gene Spring Software 11.0 (Agilent Technologies, Minnetonka, MN). After normalization, gene-expression changes in the leptin-induced group which showed at least a 2.0-fold change from that in the control group were defined as up-regulated or down-regulated. To determine significant proportions of differentially expressed genes within treated groups, the hypergeometric probability p was calculated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n              Analysis of differentially expressed genes, gene ontology and cell signaling pathways\n                We used a linear model for microarray data (LIMMA) and the empirical Bayes method to identify and compare the DEGs in the control and leptin-induced groups. DEGs were defined as significant if both the statistical p value was P < 0.05 and the fold change (FC) were >2.0. Gene ontology (GO) annotations were downloaded from internet (http://www.geneontology.org and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). All GO categories with p value < 0.05 were listed. The database of signaling pathway analysis was also obtained from the internet (http://www.genome.jp/kegg); pathway categories with p < 0.05 are reported.\n              Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis\n                The microarray data was verified by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Ten representative genes were selected from the list of differentially expressed genes. Total mRNA was extracted from 6 different rats. The RNA was reverse transcribed to synthesize cDNA using the RevertAid™ cDNA Kit (ThermoFisher, San Diego, CA). Then, PCR was carried out with the SYBR grenn Real Master mix (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Germany). Priming specificity was validated by testing melting curve of the PCR products. ß-actin was used as reference gene for analysis. The relative expression level was calculated with the 2 –<U+0394><U+0394>Ct method.\n              Statistical analysis\n                All quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard error. Between-group differences were assessed with Student t-test. Multi-group (=3) comparisons were performed with one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Scheffe’s test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n              ResultsLeptin induces inflammation and degradation of articular cartilage\n                Safranin O staining marks proteoglycan/glycosaminoglycans (GAG) of hyaline cartilage, and is widely used to detect proteoglycan/GAG content in articular cartilage [24]. In this study, histological examination (Safranin O staining) of cartilage on tibial plateaus in rat was performed in both leptin-injection and control groups. In the control group, the superficial zone of the cartilage was smooth and intact. Positive staining of Safranin O indicated no loss of proteoglycan in the mid- or deep zones (Fig. 1a). In contrast, cartilage from leptin-injection group showed proteoglycan depletion from the superficial zone to the mid-zone, 4 weeks after intra-articular injection of leptin (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, cartilage from leptin injection group displayed early-stage osteoarthritic phenotype, including swelling, superficial destruction and extensive loss of proteoglycan staining at 8 weeks post -injection (Fig. 1c). We also determined OARSI score as a measure of the severity of osteoarthritis. Scores for both medial tibial plateau and medial femoral condyle in the leptin-induced group were significantly higher than those in the control group. These results suggest that leptin may have induced the onset of OA by reducing the GAG content in the cartilage matrix.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Histological examination of leptin-induced cartilage and healthy cartilage. Safranin O-/fast green-/hematoxylin-stained midsagittal sections of knee joints of rats in the control group (a), leptin-induced group at 4 weeks (b) and leptin-induced group at 8 weeks (c). Articular cartilage tissue in leptin-induced group lost glycosaminoglycans not only in the superficial zone but also down deep in the middle zone. Original magnification × 40. (d-e) OARSI score was obtained to quantify the severity of cartilage degradation. Data are presented as a box and whisker diagram. Upper and lower bars represent maximum and minimum. Edges of the box represent the first quartile, median and third quartile. The line in the middle represents the median. NS = Not significant; MTP = medial tibial plateau; MFC = medial femoral condyle. P values calculated by one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffe’s test\n                      \n              Differential gene expression between health and leptin-induced cartilage\n                Genome wide gene expression profiles were compared between the two groups to identify genes that showed altered expression levels in response to leptins. A total of 1857 genes (p < 0.05, FC > 2.0) were significantly different between the two groups, of which 1197 were up-regulated and 660 genes were down-regulated (Fig. 2a). Among the 1857 DEGs, the top 10 most significantly up-regulated genes were ELANE, CTSG, RHAG, S100A8, SAAL1, NP4, SRGN, NKG7, PRTN3 and S100A9, while the top 10 most obviously down-regulated genes were PCK2, MTNRLA, OLR322, ACTRT2, IRAK2, ATP2B2, PCDH15, OLR1230, CD80 and ZBTB5 (Table 1). Some notable changes were observed in genes that are well known for their strong correlation with OA pathology, such as Wnt-inhibitor frizzled related protein beta [25] (FRZB, 2.76-fold down in leptin-induced group). The complete list of DEGs is provided in Additional file 1: Table S1.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Microarray analysis and RT-qPCR verification. (a) Global comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the control and leptin-induced groups is illustrated by heat maps. One-thousand and eight-hundred fifty-seven genes (p < 0.05, FC > 2.0) were found to be expressed at significantly different levels between the two groups, including 1197 upregulated and 660 downregulated genes. Upregulated genes are shown in the heat map in red color, down-regulated ones are in green color; evenly expressed genes are in black color. (b) Verification of microarray data on RT-qPCR.

Selection of these 10 genes was based on their importance in certain signaling pathways. Most of the tested genes showed similar results on microarray analysis and RT-qPCR (Fig. 2b). Primer sequences of the 10 genes are listed in supplementary material (Additional file 2: Table S2).\n              GO and pathway analysis of DEGs in leptin-affected cartilage\n                We defined significant KEGG pathways as those associated with p value <0.05. The significantly regulated pathways primarily included those involved in osteoclastic differentiation, intestinal immune network, chemokine signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, cytokine-receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction and apoptosis (Fig. 3a). The DEGs involved in significantly regulated pathways are listed in Additional file 3: Table S3.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Analysis of gene ontology (GO) and cell signaling pathways.

The GO categories of genes that were a significant between-group difference were those associated with inflammatory response, cytokine production, regulation of protein secretion, positive regulation of cellular metabolic processes, programmed cell death, extracellular matrix, ERK1/2 cascade and the MAPK cascade (Fig. 3b). One notable part of these GO terms was related to inflammation (e.g. interleukin-8 [IL-8]). Significant GO terms of DEGs and all related data are displayed in Additional file 4: Table S4.\n              Comparison with previous microarray studies in OA\n                To further explore whether leptin is involved in the pathogenesis of OA, our leptin-mediated gene expression profile was compared with those of two previous microarray studies performed by Zhu et al. [26] and Meng et al. [27]. In the study by Zhu et al., a total of 82 differentially expressed genes were reported, many of which are known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, including inflammatory factors and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), growth factors, apoptosis, energy and other related genes. In the second study, 138 genes or expressed sequence tags were reported as up- or down-regulated by at least 2-fold, which suggests that these genes may be involved in the progression of OA.\n                On data analysis and comparison with the available literature, our microarray results were divided into two groups (Table 2). On one hand, the expression of some OA-related genes including MMPs (e.g. MMP-3), inflammatory factors (e.g. IL-1ß) and growth factors (e.g. IGFBP6) was significantly up-regulated by leptin induction. This suggests that leptin indeed played important roles in the pathogenesis of OA by adjusting these protein levels, which is consistent with previous reports. On the other hand, our leptin-induced gene expression profile revealed new candidate genes (e.g. BCL2L11) whose expression was obviously increased, but was overlooked in the previous microarray reports. Recently, BCL2L11 (known as BIM) was shown to interact with other members of the BCL2 protein family and act as an apoptotic activator [28–30]. In the study by Zhu et al., Fas-induced chondrocyte apoptosis stimulated progression of OA, while our data indicates that leptin might mediate the onset and development of OA via activation of another pro-apoptosis gene (BCL2L11) rather than Fas (FC = 1.2). These findings may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie OA and potentially unravel new therapeutic targets. Our findings suggest that leptin is an important player in the progression of OA and that its effect may be mediated via modulation of expressions of multiple related genes; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be studied further.Table 2\n                        Leptin-induced genes associated with OA in this study\n                      Accession numberGene symbolDescriptionFold changeNM_133523\n                              MMP3\n                            Rattus norvegicus matrix metallopeptidase 32.87NM_031055\n                              MMP9\n                            Rattus norvegicus matrix metallopeptidase 92.09NM_133530\n                              MMP13\n                            Rattus norvegicus matrix metallopeptidase 132.06NM_031512\n                              IL-1ß\n                            Rattus norvegicus interleukin 1 beta3.01NM_012589\n                              IL-6\n                            Rattus norvegicus interleukin 64.66NM_013110\n                              IL-7\n                            Rattus norvegicus interleukin 72.86NM_012854\n                              IL-10\n                            Rattus norvegicus interleukin 103.43NM_013104\n                              IGFBP6\n                            Rattus norvegicus insulin-like growth factor binding protein 68.28NM_171988\n                              BCL2L11\n                            Rattus norvegicus BCL2-like 11 (apoptosis facilitator)2.85NM_031560\n                              CTSK\n                            Rattus norvegicus cathepsin K3.61NM_133416\n                              SYK\n                            Rattus norvegicus spleen tyrosine kinase6.11AF279918\n                              RGS2\n                            regulator of G-protein signaling 22.14NM_001137622\n                              ADAMTS2\n                            Rattus norvegicus ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 22.77M12199\n                              COL1A1\n                            Rat alpha-1 type I collagen mRNA4.01NM_057149\n                              TNFSF11\n                            Rattus norvegicus tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 112.88NM_001109524\n                              CHML\n                            Rattus norvegicus choroideremia-like (Rab escort protein 2)-2.32NM_001105980\n                              NVL\n                            Rattus norvegicus nuclear VCP-like-2.54NM_001100527\n                              FRZB\n                            Rattus norvegicus frizzled-related protein-2.76\n              DiscussionIn the present study, microarray analyses of gene expression profiles were performed to identify candidate genes that are involved in the onset and progression of OA in a rat model. Bao et a used the same rat model of leptin-induced OA to study the expression profiles of healthy and leptin-induced cartilage [13]. However, they just used qPCR and Western Blot to study a limited number of genes. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first comprehensive comparison of whole genome expression profile of healthy and leptin-induced cartilage. The microarray results were validated by RT-qPCR for a selected group of genes. Several new candidate genes were found to be associated with the pathogenesis of OA for the first time.Several recent studies have shown abnormal expressions of IL-1, TNF-a and MMPs during the pathogenesis of OA [31–34]. On analyses of GO and KEGG pathways, we confirmed the important roles of these genes in the pathogenesis of OA. IL-1 is one of the most important factors implicated in cartilage degeneration during progression of OA, and a main initiator of the pathophysiological imbalance of matrix homeostasis. IL-1 was also shown to suppress anabolism of the cartilage extracellular matrix, leading to breakdown of hyaline cartilage tissue [35]. In this study, we found that genes up-regulated by leptin were associated with the cellular response to IL-1ß and IL-6. This suggested that molecular mechanism of leptin-induced OA may involve modulation of inflammatory factors. Secondly, the expression of genes encoding for catabolic enzymes (such as MMP-3, -9 and -13) was significantly up-regulated by leptin induction, which further supports the involvement of leptin in the pathogenesis of OA. Various experimental studies have documented high expression levels of MMPs in the OA cartilage. Further, endogenous MMP inhibitors have been shown to delay the progression of OA [36].Growth factors are a group of proteins that affect the cell behavior through cellular signal transduction. In articular joints, chondrocytes produce copious amounts of growth factors which are stored in the extracellular matrix. These growth factors can in turn regulate the proliferation, differentiation and metabolism of chondrocytes [37]. Changes in the expressions of some of these growth factors, such as Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6, FC = 8.28), upon stimulation by leptin is well documented. In a recent in vitro study, IGFBP-6 was shown to inhibit the actions of IGF-II as indicated by attenuation of IGF- II-induced proliferation, differentiation, migration and survival [38]. Pleiotropic effects of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) on many types of cells are well documented; for example, these were shown to inhibit apoptosis through the PI3K/Akt pathway, and to promote mitogenesis via the Ras/MAPK pathway [39]. Therefore, up-regulation of IGFBP6 in leptin-induced cartilage may induce catabolic activity in the cartilage matrix via inhibition of the protective effects of IGF-II. In addition, member 11 of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member (TNFSF 11), which is a driver of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption, appeared to be up-regulated in leptin-induced cartilage. This observation is consistent with the results of a previous OA-related study [40].Interestingly, available evidence suggests that two different pathways are involved in the apoptosis of chondrocytes during the progression of OA [41, 42]. One of these pathways is nitric oxide (NO) independent. The other one is associated with synovitis and is mediated by Fas. However, our results indicated that leptin might activate the apoptosis of chondrocytes and lead to the onset and development of OA via a new candidate pro-apoptotic gene (BCL2L11, FC = 2.9) rather than Fas (FC = 1.2).ConclusionTo summarize, we analyzed the microarray data to compare the gene expression profiles of healthy cartilage and leptin-induced cartilage, and identified a number of DEGs and expression patterns. Moreover, our findings provide some novel insights into the crucial role of leptin in the molecular mechanisms that underlie OA pathogenesis, even though it needs further evaluation.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Dr. Xiaoli Tian for expert technical assistance and his contributing to the language editing.\n                Funding\n                The present study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC project No. 81372001) and the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality Fund (grant no. 13ZR1427000).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                All data produced by the study are disclosed in the manuscript and the additional files.\n              Authors’ contributionsConceived and designed the experiments: QF, ZL.

Herein, we scan the genome-wide SNPs for a large Chinese family with PPD-II/III. We employ the refined IBD algorithm to identify the identity-by-decent (IBD) segments and compare the frequency among the patients and normal relatives. A total of 72 markers of 0.01 percentile of the permutation are identified as the peak signals. Among of them, 57markers locate on chromosome 7q36 which is associated with PPD. Further analyses refine the mapping of candidate region in chromosome 7q36 into two 380 Kb fragments within LMBR1 and SHH respectively. IBD approach is a suitable method for mapping causal gene of human disease. Target-enrichment sequencing as well as functional experiments are required to illustrate the pathogenic mechanisms for PPD in the future.KeywordsPPDIBD7q36\n                LMBR1\n              \n                SHH\n              Main textBackground\n                Preaxial polydactyly (PPD; OMIM#188740) is characterized as complete or partial duplication of the thumb [1]. It is one of the most common congenital deformities [2]. The worldwide incidence of PPD is 1 in 3000 births [3]. The prevalence rate of polydactyly in Chinese ranks third in birth defects after congenital heart diseases and central nervous system diseases [4]. Polydactyly has genetic and clinical heterogeneity [2]. The mainstream treatment is resection for excess digits.\n                A series of efforts have been performed to investigate the genetic basis for PPD. Zguricas et al. conducted linkage analysis for Dutch, British, Turkish, Cuban pedigrees and mapped the candidate region to a 1.9 cM interval between D7S550 and D7S2423 of 7q36 region [5]. Heus et al. further refined the candidate region to approximately 450 Kb including five genes: C7orf2 (i.e. LMBR1), C7orf3 (i.e. NOM1), C7orf4 (i.e. LINC00244), HLXB9 (i.e. MNX1) and RNF32 [6] by reconstructed a detailed physical map using a combination of exon trapping, cDNA selection, and EST mapping methods. Further evidence shows that PPD is caused by ectopic expression of SHH in mice, cats and humans [7]. The zone of polarizing activity regulatory sequence (ZRS), performs as the limb-specific cis-regulator, in controlling the expression of SHH. ZRS locates within intron 5 of the neighboring gene LMBR1, which is ~1 Mb upstream from SHH [8]. In a number of cases, mutations of ZRS disturb the expression of SHH at the anterior limb bud margin and consequently caused PPD [8–15]. Homozygous deletion of ZRS can cause limb-specific absence of SHH expression in the acheiropodia [16]. It actually exists in the snake species and a limbless newt [17]. Duplication of ZRS results in Triphalangeal thumb–polysyndactyly syndrome (TPTPS; OMIM#174500), that is a subtype of PPD. It also can lead to syndactyly type IV (SD4; OMIM#186200) [18].\n                The common PPD only involves in hands/feet. In extreme and rare cases, PPD occur both in hands and feet. To investigate the genetic basis, Li et al. adopted a candidate gene approach to genotype nine microsatellite markers of 7q36 chromosomal region in a Chinese family with PPD both in hands and feet. By linkage analysis and haplotype construction, they located the linked region spanning 1.7 Mb between D7S2465 and D7D2423 [19]. It includes the 450 kb candidate region previously identified by Henus [6]. Nevertheless, the other parts of genome is not investigated yet. Herein, we genotyped genome-wide SNPs and employed the identity-by-descent (IBD) to refine the mapping of potential candidate loci for PPD in the same family.\n              MethodsPatients\n                This study has been approved by the internal review board of Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SMKX 2012013). The six-generation pedigree (including 21 patients and 24 normal relatives) involved in this study has been described previously in Li et al. [19]. All patients show hexadactyly of hands and feet. They have been diagnosed by physical examination & X-ray and assigned as isolated PPD-II on hand and isolated PPD-III on feet according to Temtamy and McKusick’s classification [20]. PPD shows autosomal dominant inheritance in this pedigree.\n              SNP array\n                We genotyped 900,015 markers in 45 individual with HumanOmniZhongHua-8 BeadChip v1.0 (Illumina). We exported the chip data in accordance with the reference sequence GRCh37 into PLINK format via GenomeStudio (Illumina). The markers on mitochondrial DNA and sex chromosomes were disregarded. We adopted a series of quality control strategies [21] by using PLINK 1.9 [22]. Two individuals with call rate < 90% were removed. The SNPs with call rate < 90%, minor allele frequency < 1%, and deviation of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P < 1e-6) were excluded. After filtering, a total of 595,534 autosomal SNPs for 43 individuals were utilized in subsequent analyses. The data have been deposited into the Genome Variation Map [23] (GVM000001).\n              IBD detection\n                We used BEAGLE 4.0 [24] to phase and impute the genotype data referring to the pedigree information and the genetic map of HapMapII [25]. We detected the IBD segment with the refined IBD in BEAGLE 4.1 [26]. The IBD segment length shorter than 1 cM and the logarithm of odds (LOD) score under 3 were excluded before permutation [27]. The threshold of the genome-wide significance was set to the 0.05 percentile of the distribution of the permutation p-value.\n              ResultsThe length distribution of detected IBD segments approximates a Pareto distribution (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The permutation result shows the significant segments distributing widely across genomes (Fig. 1). When considering the top 0.01% outliers of signals, we find the peak signals of 72 SNPs, of which 57 markers locate at 7q36 chromosomal region (Additional file 2: Table S1). We map the markers into the IBD fragments including LMBR1 and SHH (Table 1). The minimal IBD segments within LMBR1 and SHH are around 380 Kb, respectively (Additional file 3: Table S2). The IBD segments are more frequently in patient-patient (ratio; percentage) than normal-normal (ratio; percentage) (Table 2). We make annotation for the significant SNPs (Additional file 2: Table S1). All the SNPs are not haven’t been reported to be associated with PPD before.\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Permutation analysis after filtering out regions with low IBD sharing.

The segment for LMBR1 includes three genes (i.e. LMBR1, NOM1, and RNF32) and lies within the 450 kb candidate region identified before [6].Mutations in the ZRS is playing an important role in the pathogenesis of PPD (Additional file 4: Table S3). The duplication of ZRS can cause TPTPS and SD4 [18]. Its role in PPD-II /PPD-III is unclear. In the previous investigation of the same family, Li et al. detected no pathogenic mutation in ZRS as well as no duplication of ZRS [19]. Consequently, the etiology of this PPD family may be another limb-specific regulatory element of SHH gene exists in the noncoding region.In addition to the segment of LMBR1, we also identified a segment of SHH. The SHH gene encodes sonic hedgehog, a secreted protein, which plays a key role in the limb development [28]. The ectopic expression of SHH in the anterior limb margin can cause PPD in human, in mouse [29], Hemingway cat [7] and chicken [30]. Recently, Petit et al. identified a 2 kb deletion occurring about 240 kb upstream from the SHH promoter in a large family with PPD-hypertrichosis. They found the 2 kb deletion repress the transcriptional activity of the SHH promoter in vitro [31]. It raises a possibility that long range regulation may be an explanation for the PPD. Further target-enrichment sequencing and further functional experiments for LMBR1 and SHH are required to identify the pathogenic mutation(s).In summary, we refine the mapping of the candidate regions for PPD based on high-density genomic SNPs. The potential candidate mutations are most likely to locate in LMBR1 and/or SHH gene. It is much improved compred with previous results [6, 19]. Our study suggests that the IBD approach is a suitable method for mapping the causal genes of human diseases. Moreover, as disruptions of topological chromatin domains can result in limb malformations [32], more attention should be paid when studying PPD in the future on this aspect.Abbreviations\n                IBD: \n                    Identity by descent\n                  \n                    LINC00244\n                  : \n                    Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 244\n                  \n                    LMBR1\n                  : \n                    Limb development membrane protein 1\n                  \n                    MNX1\n                  : \n                    Motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1\n                  \n                    NOM1\n                  : \n                    Nucleolar protein with MIF4G domain 1\n                  PPD: \n                    Preaxial polydactyly\n                  \n                    RNF32\n                  : \n                    Ring finger protein 32\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsWe thank the volunteers for participating in this research.

The establishment of a core collection for crops is practical for efficient management and use of germplasm. However, the establishment of a core collection of mushrooms is still in its infancy, and no established core collection of the economically important species Flammulina velutipes has been reported.\n              \n                Results\n                We established the first core collection of F. velutipes, containing 32 strains based on 81 genetically different F. veltuipes strains. The allele retention proportion of the core collection for the entire collection was 100%. Moreover, the genetic diversity parameters (the effective number of alleles, Nei’s expected heterozygosity, the number of observed heterozygosity, and Shannon’s information index) of the core collection showed no significant differences from the entire collection (p > 0.01). Thus, the core collection is representative of the genetic diversity of the entire collection. Genetic structure analyses of the core collection revealed that the 32 strains could be clustered into 6 groups, among which groups 1 to 3 were cultivars and groups 4 to 6 were wild strains. The wild strains from different locations harbor their own specific alleles, and were clustered stringently in accordance with their geographic origins. Genetic diversity analyses of the core collection revealed that the wild strains possessed greater genetic diversity than the cultivars.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                We established the first core collection of F. velutipes in China, which is an important platform for efficient breeding of this mushroom in the future. In addition, the wild strains in the core collection possess favorable agronomic characters and produce unique bioactive compounds, adding value to the platform. More attention should be paid to wild strains in further strain breeding.\n              KeywordsCore setMolecular breedingMolecular markerMicrosatellitesBackgroundA core collection is a subset of accessions that presents the maximum possible genetic diversity contained in an entire collection with minimum redundancy [1, 2]. The establishment of a core collection for crops is practical for efficient management of germplasm. Core collections of most major food crops, such as Oryza sativa, Zea mays, Glycine max and Triticum aestivum, have already been established [3–7].A core collection is traditionally constructed based on morphological and agronomic characters using different strategies, such as the constant allocation (C) strategy, the logarithm (L) strategy, the proportional allocation (P) strategy, and the random sampling (R) strategy [2, 8–10]. However, most morphological and agronomic characters are quantitative traits that can be easily affected by environmental variation [11–13]. Therefore, phenotypic data cannot directly reflect the genetic diversity of germplasm resources [11].Conversely, molecular markers can directly reflect a germplasm’s genetic diversity at the DNA sequence level. Compared with other molecular markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are randomly repeated DNA sequences, generally 1 to 6 base pairs in length per unit. SSRs can spread extensively throughout a genome. They are typically co-dominant, highly polymorphic, reproducible and easy to score [14–16]. Based on molecular marker data, Kim et al. [17] developed software named PowerCore by applying the advanced maximization (M) strategy with heuristic searching to establish a core collection (allele mining collection); it allows all alleles to be captured in a minimum number of accessions [17]. It has been successfully used with many economically important crops, such as Oryza sativa, Glycine max, Olea europaea, Vigna radiata, and Sesamum indicum and has been proven to be most suitable for establishing a core collection based on molecular data [18–22].However, the development of core collections of edible mushrooms is still at an early stage, and core collections have been established only in Pleurotus ostreatus and Lentinula edodes [23–25]. Flammulina velutipes is cultivated on a large scale in East Asia [26–28]. China is currently the largest producer of F. velutipes, with an annual production of 2.4 million tons [29]. In our previous study, we obtained 124 strains (110 cultivars from the spawn market of China and 14 wild strains from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hunan provinces), and excluded cultivars labeled with confusing names, then screened out 81 strains that are genetically different [30]. In order to efficiently manage and utilize of these genetically different strains, a smaller representative core collection without redundant strains is urgently needed.In this study, we aimed to (i) establish the core collection of F. velutipes; (ii) evaluate the genetic diversity of the core collection and the entire collection; and (iii) analyze the core collection’s genetic structure.MethodsStrain materials and DNA extraction\n                We used 81 strains of F. velutipes in this study, including 67 cultivars and 14 wild strains (Additional file 1: Table S1). Genomic DNA was extracted for each strain with the CTAB-based method [31]. In each case, fresh mycelium was harvested from potato dextrose agar medium after inoculation for 10 days at 23 °C. The DNA concentration and purity were measured with a NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer. The DNA solution of each sample was diluted to 100 ng/µl.\n              SSR genotyping\n                The 25 polymorphic SSR markers used in this study were developed by our previous study [30]. The forward primer of each SSR was labeled with fluorescent dye (FAM) at the 5' end (TSINGKE, Kunming). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out in a total volume of 25 µl, containing 1 µl template DNA, 1 µl bovine serum albumin, 2.5 µl reaction buffer, 0.5 µl deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 µl for each primer, 0.3 µl Taq DNA polymerase, and 17.7 µl ddH2O. PCR was conducted on an ABI 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or an Eppendorf Master Cycler (Netheler-Hinz, Hamburg, Germany) under the following parameters: 94 °C for 4 min, then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 8 min. The PCR products were run in an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer using GeneScan 500 Rox as a size standard (Applied Biosystems); after a denaturation step at 98 °C for 5 min and shock chilling on ice, alleles of each locus were scored in base pairs with the GeneMapper v3.2 software package (Applied Biosystems), the size of the PCR products for each SSR was recorded in an Excel spreadsheet.\n              Development of a core collection for F. velutipes\n                        \n                The core collection was established based on genotyping data using PowerCore software [17]. The heuristic algorithm that finds the optimum path from the initial to the final stages for sample selection was used (http://genebank.rda).\n              Data analysis\n                The genetic diversity parameters (the effective number of alleles Ae, Nei’s expected heterozygosity H, the number of observed heterozygosity Ho, and Shannon’s information index I) and allele frequency of the core collection and of the entire collection were established with PopGene v1.31 [32]. A dendrogram of the genetic relationships among the core collection strains was constructed based on the simple matching (SM) coefficient by applying the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) using the NTSYSpc v2.10e [33]. The genetic structure of the core collection was analyzed with STRUCTURE v2.3.4 based on an admixture model. Models were tested for K-values ranging from 2 to 10, with 10 independent runs per K value. For each run, the initial burn-in period was set to 100,000 with 100,000 MCMC iterations. To determine the most probable value of K, the deltaK method was used and implemented in Structure Harvester [34, 35].\n              ResultsCore collection construction\n                A total of 153 alleles were amplified by 25 SSRs in the 81 strains [30]. In this study, based on PowerCore calculation, the 153 alleles could be represented using a minimum of 32 strains, including 19 cultivars and 13 wild strains (Table 1). This finding suggests that the 32 strains could be a core collection of the 81 strains. The core collection sampling proportion is about 39.5%: for cultivars about 27.9%, and for wild strains about 92.9%.Table 1\n                        Strains in the core collection selected by PowerCore\n                      StrainCultivar/wildPileus colororiginStrainCultivar/wildPileus colororiginF37CultivarYellowShandongF80CultivarYellowHenanF114CultivarYellowShandongF87CultivarYellowHebeiF1CultivarYellowBeijingF79CultivarYellowHenanF6CultivarYellowBeijingF146WildYellowHunanF89CultivarYellowHebeiF147WildYellowHunanF115CultivarYellowShandongF148WildYellowHunanF58CultivarYellowHeilongjiangF77WildYellowJilinF112CultivarYellowShandongF92WildYellowSichuanF117CultivarWhiteLiaoningF93WildYellowSichuanF106CultivarYellowFujianF94WildYellowSichuanF133CultivarWhiteHunanF91WildYellowYunnanF19CultivarWhiteSichuanF149WildYellowYunnanF78CultivarWhiteJilinF99WildYellowYunnanF26CultivarWhiteShijiazhuangF101WildYellowYunnanF116CultivarWhiteLiaoningF98WildYellowYunnanF151CultivarWhiteKunmingF103WildYellowYunnan\n              Genetic diversity of the core collection\n                Statistics to describe the genetic diversity of the core collection and the entire collection for 25 SSR markers are summarized in Table 2. The t-tests of the mean genetic diversity parameters (Ae, H, Ho, I) of the core collection and the entire collection were non-significant (p > 0.01) (Table 2), which reveals that the genetic diversity of the core collection has no significant difference from that of the entire collection. In addition, based on an UPGMA dendrogram of the core collection and the entire collection (Fig. 1), the strains in different groups of the entire collection were uniformly selected for the core collection. Thus, the core collection could represent the genetic diversity of the entire collection. However, the distributions of allele frequency differ between the entire collection and the core collection (Additional file 2: Table S2).Table 2\n                        Genetic diversity parameters in entire collection and core collection\n                      Locus nameAeHHoIEntireCoreEntireCoreEntireCoreEntireCoreSSR11.8332.7790.4550.640.370.50.9261.29SSR22.8463.850.6490.740.6170.7191.2861.589SSR41.0511.1360.0490.120.0370.0940.1410.299SSR51.0251.0650.0250.0610.0250.0630.0750.161SSR72.9493.7170.6610.7310.7160.6251.2411.424SSR151.9641.8820.4910.4690.3460.250.6840.662SSR191.8392.0040.4560.5010.580.5940.7280.854SSR213.9055.020.7440.8010.4570.4381.5761.757SSR223.6195.1710.7240.8070.4440.3131.591.949SSR231.5521.4680.3560.3190.370.250.6240.618SSR241.6131.7790.380.4380.1730.2190.780.946SSR251.2121.5560.1750.3570.0740.1250.4750.874SSR261.1481.2530.1290.2020.1360.2190.30.45SSR323.1875.9880.6860.8330.2590.2191.6692.163SSR452.3853.1270.5810.680.4820.3131.121.388SSR872.6173.8940.6180.7430.4570.4061.1961.559SSR651.2761.7670.2160.4340.1480.3130.5360.95SSR1242.3832.9220.5800.6580.4820.5631.0391.289SSR1332.1764.0470.5410.7530.2220.3131.2541.755SSR951.8951.9790.4720.4950.6050.6560.7250.742SSR1071.5532.1860.3560.5430.2720.3440.8261.2SSR1191.2251.5350.1840.3490.0860.1250.4250.726SSR1281.7051.6360.4130.3890.4690.3130.6470.657SSR1323.02440.6690.750.6670.5941.2931.521SSR1361.1191.3340.1060.2510.0120.0310.250.496mean2.0442.6840.4290.5220.340.3440.8561.093\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        UPGMA dendrogram of core collection (32 accessions) and entire collection (81 accessions) of F. velutipes constructed based on genetic similarity coefficients of SSR data in the core collection and entire collection, respectively.

Group 6 had the highest number of specific alleles (30), followed by group 4 (13), group 5 (11), group 1 (8), group 2 (7), and group 3 (3) (Fig. 2). Nearly 53% of the alleles (81 of 153) were common to all the groups and can thus be categorized as conserved alleles (Fig. 2).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Venn diagram demonstrates common and specific alleles distributed in 6 groups\n                      \n              Genetic structure of the core collection\n                The admixture model-based clustering method was used in the STRUCTURE program to infer the genetic structure of the core collection. The optimum number of K was analyzed using delta K (<U+0394>K). A strong peak of <U+0394>K is six, which indicated that there were six groups in the core collection (Fig. 3). The cultivars were assigned to groups 1 to 3, and the wild strains were assigned to groups 4 to 6 (Fig. 4).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Estimation of number of populations for K ranging from 2 to 10 by <U+0394>K values\n                      \n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Estimated genetic structure for K = 6.

For the cultivars, white strains were assigned to groups 2 and 3, and yellow strains were distributed throughout groups 1 to 3. The wild strains were clustered in groups 4 to 6, and each group was stringently in accordance with its geographic origins. The strains in group 4 were collected from Hunan Province, with the exception of strain F77, which was purchased from Spawn Company in Jilin Province in northeastern China. This strain shares similar alleles with the strains collected from Hunan Province, indicating that it may have been isolated from Hunan Province. The strains in groups 5 and 6 were collected from Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces, respectively.\n              DiscussionRepresentation of the core collection\n                The successful formation of a core collection depends on maximum allelic representation efficiency and elimination of redundancy from the entire collection [2]. In this study, we successfully developed a core collection of F. velutipes with 100% allelic representation under 39.5% of the sampling proportion (28.4% for cultivars and 92.9% for wild strains) based on 25 SSR markers. The genetic diversity parameters of the core collection could represent of the entire collection. And the strains selected in the core collection can represent the different allele components of each group in the entire collection (Fig. 1). Our results proved that the advanced M strategy is powerful in capturing 100% allelic diversity in a core collection [17, 22]. The differences of the allele frequency between the entire collection and the core collection may be due to the redundant alleles including some homozygous loci that were excluded during the core collection construction.\n              Further strain improvement of F. velutipes based on the core collection\n                Most crops inevitably undergo a drastic loss of genetic diversity during cultivation, and F. velutipes is no exception [30, 36–38]. Lower genetic diversity among cultivars may lead to inbreeding depression [39]. Thus, the core collection established in this study could effectively protect the cultivars’ heterogeneous germplasm resources and help avoid inbreeding depression for further strain improvement. Furthermore, the specific alleles harbored in different groups of cultivars may indicate different agronomic characters in each group. For example, in our previous experiment, the mycelium growth rate at 23 °C of a yellow strain F1 (6.38 ± 0.1 mm/d) in group 1 was significantly greater than that of the industrialized white strain F3 (6.35 ± 0.07 mm/d) (p < 0.01) (unpublished data). Therefore, F1 could be used to crossbreed with the industrialized white strains to facilitate mycelium growth and shorten the production time.\n                The wild strains harbor higher genetic diversity than the cultivars in the core collection. Meanwhile, several economically important agronomic traits, such as tolerance to high temperature and rich contents of sesquiterpenes, can also be found in wild strains [30, 40]. In the cultivation of F. velutipes, temperature is usually an important limiting factor. The cultivars’ fruiting temperature needed for stringent control is less than 15 °C, which will result in high energy costs [30]. However, we have gathered several wild strains of F. velutipes from subtropical regions of China in summer, despite most of the wild strains of this species mainly forming fruiting bodies in winter. Thus, those wild strains are ideal samples to domesticate for tolerance to high temperatures. In fact, we did find a wild strain (F98), collected from Longling, Yunnan, that can grow more vigorously than cultivars at a higher temperature (18 °C) [30]. Further analyses on chemical components showed that this strain contains 15 new sesquiterpenes with various skeletons, some of which showed moderate antidiabetes and antitumor bioactivity [40]. Thus, it is quite essential to keep as many wild strains as possible in constructing a core collection for F. velutipes.\n              ConclusionsIn conclusion, we have established the first core collection of F. velutipes in China, which is an important platform for efficient breeding of this mushroom in the future. The core collection is representative of the entire collection. In addition, the wild strains in the core collection possess favorable agronomic characters and produce unique bioactive compounds, adding value to the platform. More attention should be paid to wild strains in further strain breeding.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to Dr. Min Zhang (Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences), Dr. Yong-Chang Zhao (Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences), Dr. Jin-Xia Zhang (Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences), Dr. Bao-Gui Xie (Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University), Dr. Ping Zhang (Hunan Normal University) and Mr. Pan-Meng Wang (Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences) for providing strains for this study.

Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation of skin color in various populations has many implications in human evolution and medicine.\n              \n                Discussion\n                Impressive progress has been made recently to identify genes associated with skin color variation in a wide range of geographical and temporal populations. In this review, we discuss what is currently known about the genetics of skin color variation. We enumerated several cases of skin color adaptation in global modern humans and archaic hominins, and illustrated why, when, and how skin color adaptation occurred in different populations. Finally, we provided a summary of the candidate loci associated with pigmentation, which could be a valuable reference for further evolutionary and medical studies.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Previous studies generally indicated a complex genetic mechanism underlying the skin color variation, expanding our understanding of the role of population demographic history and natural selection in shaping genetic and phenotypic diversity in humans. Future work is needed to dissect the genetic architecture of skin color adaptation in numerous ethnic minority groups around the world, which remains relatively obscure compared with that of major continental groups, and to unravel the exact genetic basis of skin color adaptation.\n              KeywordsSkin colorNatural selectionGenetic adaptationModern humansArchaic homininBackgroundSince modern humans ventured out of Africa ~100,000 years ago, they spread across continents into a variety of habitats, from tropical zones to the arctic, and from lowlands to highlands. During migration, selective pressures in local environments (e.g., the cold climate, hypoxia, and endemic pathogens), together with random drift, have resulted in population-specific genetic variants, which further influenced variable phenotypes, such as lactose tolerance, height, immune system, and metabolic efficiency.Skin color variation is one of the most striking examples of human phenotypic diversity. It is dominated by melanin, a pigmentation located in the base of the epidermis and produced by melanocytes. Melanin has two forms, pheomelanin (yellow-reddish) and eumelanin (black-brown). The former is mainly accumulated in the light-complexioned people, while the latter is mostly produced in the dark-complexioned people [1–5]. In addition, the number and size of melanin particles differ among individuals, and is even more important than the proportions of the two forms of melanin in the determination of human skin color [5]. Other skin-related factors, e.g., keratin, also contribute to skin color variation [6, 7].In global populations, skin color is highly correlated with latitude, and fundamentally, the distribution of ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Fig. 1). Populations closer to the equator tend to have dark skin for protection against UV, since overexposure to UV may decrease folic acid levels [8, 9] and cause skin cancer [10–13]. The lighter skin in populations at higher latitudes is underlying selection to maintain vitamin D photosynthesis, which is a UV-dependent process [14, 15].\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Correlation between skin color and latitude (from Barsh (2003) [5]). (a) A map of human skin color distribution. (b) A plot of skin reflectance against latitude\n                    Although UV has been assumed to be a driving force for the evolution of human skin colors, understanding the exact genetic mechanism of selection would be crucial to reconstruct human evolutionary history and elucidate the microevolution of adaptive traits. Describing a full picture of regional skin color adaptation in humans would be challenging because it includes not only the genes identified to be under selection, but also the extent to which these genes could explain phenotypic variation, the interactions and joint effects of genes, and the way they react to the external environments. In this article, we reviewed several cases of skin color adaptation in various populations of modern humans and archaic hominins. These cases show the similarities and differences of mechanisms of skin color adaptation across populations, and provide some insights into human evolutionary history.Skin color adaptation in modern Eurasians\n                In Europeans, SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 [16–19] are two golden genes related to the evolution of the light skin color. SLC24A5 encodes the NCKX5 protein, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family and regulates the calcium concentration in the melanosome [16]. This gene has been confirmed to affect pigmentation in zebrafish and mice [16, 20]. Especially, the derived allele of rs1426654 in SLC24A5 was found to be nearly fixed in Europeans, but almost missing in populations without any European ancestry (Fig. 2) [21]. A 78-kb haplotype around SLC24A5, which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs1426654, was also identified to accumulate in Europeans [22]. A similar pattern can be observed at rs16891982 in SLC45A2 [23], which has been reported to be associated with pigmentation in several species, e.g., mice, fish, birds, and horses [24–26]. Other variants in this gene, including rs26722, rs2287949, and rs40132, were also shown to be coloration-associated in Europeans [23, 27, 28]. Another important pigmentation-related gene identified in European is MC1R [29–31]. This gene is expressed in melanocytes and plays a key role in controlling the switch from pheomelanin to eumelanin [31]. The pigmentary phenotypes associated with MC1R has been studied in a wide range of animals [32–34]. Many variants have been identified in MC1R, such as rs1805007, rs1805008, and rs3212357 [35, 36], despite its small size (951 bp). Other important European-specific loci include rs1393350 in TYR, rs2733831 in TYRP1, and rs1900758 in OCA2 [17, 28, 37–39]. The derived allele frequencies at these loci are high in Europeans but low in Africans and East Asians, which could be a clear signal of positive selection in Europeans, as indicated by statistical analysis [40].\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Evolutionary model of human pigmentation in three continental populations. The rooted tree shows the genetic phylogeny of human populations from Africa, North Europe and East Asia, with the colors of the branches roughly indicating the generalized skin pigmetation level of these populations (adapted from McEvoy et al. (2006) [39]). Genetic loci reported to be under positive selection in the common ancestor of modern Eurasians are represented by rs1881227 in KITLG, and those independently evolved in Europeans and East Asians, indicating possible convergent evolution, are represented by rs12913832 in OCA2 and rs885479 in MC1R, respectively. The maps of allele frequency were drawn using R (version 3.2.1, https://www.r-project.org), based on these loci in 53 global populations provided by the Human Genome Diversity Panel CEPH (HGDP, http://www.hagsc.org/hgdp/index.html). Blue and red colors denote the ancestral and derived alleles, respectively\n                      \n                Genes involved in the skin color adaptation in East Asians are not that well studied compared to the long list of adaptive genes identified in Europeans. Notable examples include OCA2 and MC1R. Each harbors several non-synonymous mutations, e.g. rs1800414 and rs74653330 in OCA2, and rs885479 in MC1R [40–43], which exhibit high derived allele frequencies in East Asians, but low derived allele frequencies in Europeans and Africans (Fig. 2). The OCA2 protein is thought to be a mature melanosomal membrane protein [44], with a potential role in protein transportation into melanosomes [45]. The East Asian-specific variant of rs1800414 was first reported in an exome sequencing study aiming to figure out albinism-related variants [46]. The derived allele at rs1800414 was thought to contribute to the skin lightening in an association study of Han Chinese, which measured the skin color of individuals using the melanin index [47]. Another non-synonymous variant in OCA2, rs74653330, has also been confirmed to be pigmentation-related in an association study of Japanese [48]. Additional examples of East Asian-specific pigmentation-associated alleles include rs10809814 in TYRP1 and rs1407995 in DCT [40, 49], both of which show differentiation between Asians and non-Asians [47], and strong signals of positive selections in Asians [43, 49].\n                Despite distinct genes and variants under respective local adaptations in Europeans and East Asians, some genes have derived alleles reaching high frequencies in both continental groups. For instance, KITLG exhibits a selective sweep in non-Africans [50–52]. This gene is widely expressed in multiple tissues, including the skin, and functions in organ morphogenesis and cell proliferation. The Kit-ligand encoded by KITLG is known as the steel factor and plays a crucial role in the normal development and maintenance of the melanocyte lineage in adult skin [53]; this has been proved in human, fish, and mice [54–56]. The effects of this gene on pigmentation have also been confirmed in a series of association studies [57–60]. One of the key variants is rs642742, which is located at 326 kb upstream to the transcription start site of KITLG. At this variant, the ancestral allele frequency is over 90% in Africans, comparable to the derived allele frequency in Europeans and East Asians (Fig. 2). Similar patterns were observed in other genes, e.g., ASIP and BNC2 [39].\n                Two models of the evolutionary architecture of human pigmentation were proposed on the basis of the above results and other related studies (Fig. 2). One is a convergent evolution model [17, 40, 43, 49], suggesting that depigmentation has, to some degree, evolved independently in Europeans and East Asians, as different genes and variants have been suggested to explain the light skin and positive selection in these two continental groups. A recent study estimated the time of selective sweeps for the European-specific pigmentation variants to be around 11,000–19,000 years ago, after the divergence of Europeans and Asians [61]. An alternative model fits for the shared selective sweeps of Europeans and East Asians, which could possibly occur in proto-Eurasians. The onset of the sweep was estimated to be approximately 30,000 years ago, right after the “Out-of-Africa” migration, but earlier than the European-specific evolution on pigmentation [61]. The coexistence of these two models suggests a complex evolutionary history of skin color in modern humans.\n                Another clue of the complex genetic basis of skin color evolution is the allelic heterogeneity observed in a single gene, like OCA2 and MC1R. In each of these genes, some alleles are specific to Europeans, whereas others are specific to Asians, although they all have been proved to be depigmentation-related. In addition, OCA2 provides evidence of independent sweeps as well as convergent evolution in Europeans and Asians. Since results were obtained from studies using different samples, data, and methods, there could be some confounding factors leading to these different observations. However, more importantly, skin color is a complex trait that could not be simply explained by a single gene or variant; rather, it is likely to involve a huge network of genes and phenotypes. For instance, ASIP, an adaptive pigmentation gene in populations with European ancestry [62, 63], encodes the agouti signaling protein, which blocks MC1R in the eumelanin synthesis in response to the UV-induced DNA damage [40]. In the melanin production, TYR acts as the catalyzer of the key initial step, and its stability is maintained by TYRP1 and DCT.\n                In addition, scans for selection on skin pigmentation indicate two different selection behaviors acting on de novo mutations and standing variations, respectively. Some variants, represented by rs1805007 and rs1805008 in MC1R (in Europeans) and rs1800414 in OCA2 (in Asians), only show derived alleles in populations under positive selection at these loci, from which we could conjecture that they are new mutations that appeared after modern humans settled in Europe or Asia. In contrast, some variants, such as rs3212357 in MC1R (under positive selection in Europeans), present low frequencies in Africans. Regardless of possible mutation events and genetic drift in African populations, it is more likely that the derived allele at this locus has presented for some time before they became favored. Similar cases have been found in the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans and the immunity adaptation in some modern human populations, and even in the evolution of pigmentation phenotypes in non-human species [56, 64].\n              Skin color adaptation in the admixed populations\n                Admixed populations, the hybrid offspring of two previously isolated populations, may provide important insights in understanding the genetics of geographical variation for two reasons. First, the loci underlying phenotypic differences in ancestral populations are also overlapping the highly informative markers of ancestry, which makes the admixed populations particularly useful for tracing population history. Second, the admixed populations usually have a wide range of variations regarding some specific phenotypes, which may increase the power of locating genes associated with complex traits/diseases after controlling potential population stratification.\n                Despite these advantages, admixed populations have rarely been considered in studies of human pigmentation variation. Current studies investigating pigmentation genes in admixed populations mainly involved those with African and European ancestry, such as African Americans, European Africans, and Latin Americans, since their ancestral populations are substantially differentiated in skin color. The ancestral genetic makeups differ among these three populations. African-Americans obtained the largest genetic contribution (~80%) from the African ancestry [65], Latin American mestizos have the least proportion of African ancestry (~10%) [66, 67], while in European Africans, the genetic components inherited from Europeans (~42%) and Africans (~58%) are comparable [68]. Uniquely in the Latin Americans, a considerable proportion of Native American ancestry (~45%) exists [66, 67]. Moreover, on the individual level, the proportion of each ancestry exhibits a large variance in each admixed population. For instance, the fraction of European ancestry varies from 2% to 98% among African American individuals [65]. The large variance of skin color in admixed individuals could result from their highly diverse genetic makeup, as a substantial correlation has been observed between ancestry proportion and skin color [68–70].\n                Multiple well-known candidate genes for pigmentation in Europeans have also been identified by admixture mapping (Fig. 3) or association studies in admixed populations. For instance, TYR, carrying a non-synonymous substitution rs1042602 (S192Y), was identified in African Americans [69] and European Africans from Cape Verde [68]. Variants in ASIP, such as rs6058017, which has been found to occur at different frequencies in global populations [63], were also reported to be associated with dark hair and brown eyes in European Americans [71], African Americans [62] and Brazilians [72]. Furthermore, KITLG showed strong signals of selective sweep in African Americans [51], with a significant preference to homozygotes of the African-specific allele (ancestral allele) at rs642742 in individuals with high melanin index (dark skin) [69]. Similar cases include rs1426654 in SLC24A5 in European Africans [68] and Latin Americans [72], and rs35395 in SLC45A2 in European Africans [68].\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        A framework of admixture mapping to detect positive selection. The average faces of African, European, and African America were downloaded from http://www.mediadump.com/hosted-id167-average-faces-from-around-the-world.html#.WLkMU-kfU1A\n                                    \n                      \n                However, some studies reported discrepant results. The correlation between Native American ancestry and skin pigmentation reported in a Hispanic population [73] was not observed in a group of Puerto Rican women [70]. One of the key single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNPs) in OCA2, rs1800404, showed a significant effect on skin pigmentation when analyzing African Americans and a combined population of African American and African-Caribbean, but was absent in an independent analysis of the African-Caribbean samples [69]. It is possible that different genetic mechanisms of skin color variation exist in various populations, but cautions should be taken regarding detailed information in the data, such as sample size and the ancestral populations selected for analyzing the admixed populations, which could lead to biased results [67, 69].\n                The identification of genetic determinants of natural variation of skin pigmentation was also conducted in other admixed populations. One successful example is a genome-wide association study of a population of South Asian descent [74], in which polymorphisms in SLC24A5, TYR and SLC45A2 showed significant associations with the melanin content in skin. The light skin alleles in South Asian could possibly be inherited from their European ancestors [75], who initially arrived at this region around 3500–4000 years ago along with Indo-European language expansion [76], followed by recent colonization in the last few centuries. In addition, Central Asia and Southeast Asia are home to various admixed populations, which are likewise of great potential in the study of skin color adaptation. Admixed population analyses may greatly enrich our understanding of skin color variation in modern human populations.\n              Skin color adaptation in the aboriginal populations\n                The aboriginal populations in different areas around the world have many implications for human evolutionary history. They have been regarded as the early settlers in respective areas. Despite having been assimilated by their surrounding agriculturalists to some extent, some aboriginal people have preserved their traditional livelihoods as hunter-gatherers, as well as their original physical traits – dark skin, short stature, and curly hair.\n                The hunter-gatherer populations with dark skin, short stature and curly hair have attracted much attention (Fig. 4a). The genetic mechanism underlying the shared phenotypes among these geographically distant populations (collectively called Negritos or Pygmies), from Central Africa, the Andaman Islands, Southeast Asia and Oceania, are still controversial; for example, whether they were the common descent from a pre-Neolithic substrate of humanity or a consequence of convergent evolution [77, 78]. To date, most genetic studies on this issue have focused on height [78–81]. One study provided clues for convergent evolution from the view of skin pigmentation adaptation by analyzing MC1R diversity in the Melanesians [82]. This study showed that the ancestral haplotypes of MC1R are not highly conserved between Northern Island Melanesians and Africans, although both populations live in the high UV region, which is in contrast to previous findings based on very limited samples [30, 83]. Besides, a non-synonymous polymorphism, rs2228479, shows enriched derived alleles specifically in East Asians, but is not significantly associated with skin or hair pigmentation in Melanesians. Actually, the Melanesian population exhibits striking skin pigmentation variation [84], and consistently, some variants have been identified to be region-specific, which could partly explain this phenotypic variation. A notable example is a non-synonymous variant, rs387907171, in TYRP1 [85]. It is restricted to the Solomons and parts of the Bismarck Archipelago, and might contribute to the ‘blond hair’ in this region [85, 86]. These results emphasize the complex genetic architecture of pigmentation phenotypes, and also highlight the role that population history (e.g., the complex population history of the Southwest Pacific [87–89]) can play a role in influencing phenotypic diversity. Skin pigmentation studies on other modern aboriginal populations (besides Melanesians) are scarce, except for one investigating the Senoi population (an indigenous population) from the Malay Peninsula, which is an admixture of the Negrito (dark-skinned) and the southern Mongoloid from Indo-China (yellow-brown-skinned), and has a wide skin color spectrum [90]. The authors of this study found that despite the low derived allele frequency, the A111T mutation (rs1426654) in SLC24A5 is significantly associated with the light skin in Senoi, which was suspected to result from the admixture of the Mongoloid and South Asians.\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Skin color of aboriginal people in the Equatorial zone and the Arctic.

Portraits of Malay and Swedish individuals are provided by the Joshua Project (http://joshuaproject.net), the Bateq portrait is from http://www.businessinsider.my/, and the Inuit portrait is from http://www.arcticphoto.co.uk/\n                                    \n                      \n                Another interesting issue concerning human skin color adaptation comes from the arctic people. The Inuit people, in far North Eastern Asia and the American Subarctic, have yellowish-brown skin despite the far northern latitude at which they live, unlike other populations living at the same latitude, such as the Swedes and Finnish (Fig. 4b). This makes the Inuit population an exception of the latitude-correlated distribution of skin color. One possible reason is that the dark skin could protect the Inuits from the severe UV exposure because of the long daylight hours in winter and high levels of UV reflection from the snow. While the dark skin is a disadvantage for vitamin D production, plenty of vitamins including vitamin D could be compensated from their diets [91, 92]. Another cause could be the founder effect of the ancient East Asian ancestry of the Inuits, who have inhabited the arctic region since nearly 5000 years ago, and had higher melanin production than the European ancestry. However, very few genetic studies have been conducted to determine the genetic basis of dark skin in arctic populations.\n              Skin color adaptation in the ancient hominins\n                The dark skin in modern humans was established around 1.2 million years ago, driven by the loss of body hair after divergence from apes, presumably to protect against UV-induced damages [13, 93–96]. Then, when did modern Eurasians start to depigment? The studies on skin color adaptation summarized above are based on modern population genetic data, which may suffer from limited temporal resolution caused by the population demographic history, and insensitivity to selection acting on standing variations [97]. The advent of ancient DNA analyses makes it possible to directly observe the evolution processes, and thus would facilitate our understanding of this key question.\n                A study on the genomes of Anatolian Neolithic farmers in West Eurasia (6500–300 BC), who are probably the source population of the first European farmers, suggests that the light skin color has been evolved since at least 6500–4000 years ago [98]. Several popular genes identified in modern Eurasians, e.g., SLC45A2, GRM5 and HERC2/OCA2 showed strong signal of selection in these ancient samples. This conclusion is supported by another study based on the Eneolithic (6500–5000 BP) and Bronze Age (5000–4000 BP) samples, representing the early European farmers or late hunter-gatherers in central Europe [99]. One possible motivation of the skin depigmentation in prehistoric Eurasia is agriculturalization, which led to a switch from vitamin D-rich hunter-gatherer diet to a vitamin D-poor agriculturalist diet, together with the increased danger of folic acid deficiency at higher latitudes [14, 100]. Moreover, the selective pressures have kept operating for a long time after they initiated the adaptation of skin color, as some ancestral pigmentations alleles were identified in a Mesolithic European (7000 BP), and some adaptive alleles under selection in the ancient Eurasians are still evolving in modern humans [98, 99, 101].\n                Recent studies on archaic hominins (e.g., Neanderthals, an extinct hominid group living in Eurasia ~400,000–28,000 years ago [102]) further improved our understanding of skin color evolution in modern humans. Neanderthals met modern humans in the Middle East ~60,000–50,000 years ago, and contributed to about 1–4% of modern human genomes [103–105]. Some pigmentation-associated genes are identified in the introgressed haplotypes from Neanderthals in modern Eurasians, such as POU2F3, BNC2 and MC1R [106, 107]. Specifically, the introgressive alleles were reported to result in light skin color, suggesting an ‘adaptive introgression’ strategy of human skin color adaptation. Other introgressive genes related to skin phenotypes include HYAL genes, which are associated with cellular responses to UV and are under strong positive selection in East Asians [108], and those involved in keratin filaments formation [109]. Although these genes are not direct determinants of skin pigmentation, they, like those pigmentation-related genes, possibly helped modern humans adapt to non-African environments.\n                When drawing conclusions of adaptive introgression, we are actually claiming that Neanderthals could be light-complexioned. This inference is just based on some pigmentation-associated genes or alleles identified in existing modern human populations, since visible phenotypes of Neanderthals and other extinct species are not available. However, when using some other priory genes as potential clues, different results can be obtained. For instance, the derived state of MC1R, which is responsible for pale skin, presents in Neanderthal individuals from Italy and Spain but is missing in Croatian Neanderthals and Denisova [110], suggesting skin color variation in the archaic hominins. In addition, the light skin in Neanderthals and modern Eurasians could also result from convergent evolution, rather than adaptive introgression [111].\n                The hypothesis of adaptive introgression seems to predate when modern human became pale – long before the late Mesolithic age, as Neanderthals went extinct around 28,000 years ago. However, we should reconsider whether the genes affecting skin color in archaic hominins indeed determined skin color in modern humans. Even if this is the case, it is also possible that modern human retained these introgressive variants until they showed some phenotypic effects under some specific strong selective pressures. Thus, more data resources and analyses are necessary to address this issue in the future.\n              Selection coefficient and effect size\n                As one of the most obvious changes in the environment after modern human migrated out of Africa to higher latitudes, UV has exerted considerable selective pressures on human skin pigmentation, which can be reflected by selection coefficients of the pigmentation-related genes. The estimation of selection coefficients largely depends on the genes considered and the methodologies. Beleza et al. estimated the coefficient of selection at several loci representing SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TYRP1, and KITLG [61]. For example, the estimates are 0.05/0.04 for SLC45A2 and 0.16/0.08 for SLC24A5 under a dominant/an additive model of inheritance in Europeans. Meanwhile, López et al. reported the selection coefficient of a variant in SLC45A2 to be 0.01–0.02 in a South European populations [112]. These estimations are comparable to the selection coefficients inferred directly from serially sampled data at HERC2, SLC45A2, and TYR, ranging from 0.02–0.1 [99]. The selection coefficients estimated for pigmentation genes are best understood in the context of estimates for other recently selected loci. The selection advantages are inferred to be 0.01–0.08 for LCT, a gene strongly associated with lactase persistence in populations with European ancestry [113, 114], 0.019–0.048 for G6PD, a gene conferring malaria resistance in African populations [115], 0.03–0.19 for EDAR associated with the increased scalp hair thickness and changed tooth morphology in the Han Chinese [116], and 0.0004–0.0023 for EGLN1 and EPAS1 gene regions contributing to the high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans [117]. The selection coefficients for pigmentation genes are among the most strongly selected genes in the human genome, indicating a severe selective pressure caused by UV or some other environmental changes in non-African regions.\n                Although a large number of genes have been identified to contribute to skin color variation, how much could they explain the skin color variation in modern humans? Is there a gene or variant that has a dominant effect on the skin color? Some genes could possibly play a major role in determining skin color in specific populations. For instance, the light skin variant at rs1426654 in SLC24A5 could explain 22–32% of the variance of the melanin index in South Asian [75] and 25–38% in African-American and African-Caribbean populations [118]. Additionally, the derived allele at rs642742 in KITLG may account for lightening of a person’s skin by 6 to 7 melanin units, nearly 1/5 of the overall skin reflectance difference between West Africans and Europeans (30 melanin units) [56]. However, there are relatively more genes and variants with smaller effects. One of the key variants in OCA2, rs1800414, could explain around 4% of the pigmentation variation in East Asian populations [47]. In South Asians, rs16891982 in SLC45A2 and rs1042602 in TYR account for 3.6% and 2.5% skin color variation, respectively, much less than the effect size of rs1426654 in SLC24A5 [74]. The inheritance mode of skin pigmentation follows an additive model, or at least an incomplete additive model [16, 17, 47, 56, 75].\n              ConclusionsOverall, human skin color is a highly variable and complex trait as a consequence of strong selection pressure and is controlled by multiple genetic loci (summarized in Table 1). Skin color adaptation is a complex process because different populations have shared and independent genetic mechanisms involving a large number of genes with different effect advantages on the phenotype. Skin color adaptation is also a long evolutionary process influenced by various historical, even pre-historical, population genetic events. Current studies provide comprehensive insights into the natural selection process and mechanisms of human skin color variation. A richer resource of high-coverage whole-genome sequences and phenotype data may provide opportunities to further speculate an accurate model of genetic architecture and gene-environment effects, and advance our understanding of skin pigmentation in certain minor ethnic groups, such as hunter-gatherers and highlanders. We believe that these studies may greatly enrich our knowledge of human evolution history and elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits in humans.Table 1\n                    A summary of

With the current human population growth rate, there is an increasing need to raise wheat productivity by means of plant breeding, along with development of more efficient and sustainable agricultural systems. Damage by pathogens and pests, in combination with adverse climate effects, need to be counteracted by incorporating new germplasm that makes wheat more resistant/tolerant to such stress factors. Rye has been used as a source for improved resistance to pathogens and pests in wheat during more than 50 years. With new devastating stem and yellow rust pathotypes invading wheat at large acreage globally, along with new biotypes of pest insects, there is renewed interest in using rye as a source of resistance.Currently the proportion of wheat cultivars with rye chromatin varies between countries, with examples of up to 34%. There is mainly one rye source, Petkus, that has been widely exploited and that has contributed considerably to raise yields and increase disease resistance in wheat. Successively, the multiple disease resistances conferred by this source has been overcome by new pathotypes of leaf rust, yellow rust, stem rust and powdery mildew. However, there are several other rye sources reported to make wheat more resistant to various biotic constraints when their rye chromatin has been transferred to wheat. There is also development of knowledge on how to produce new rye translocation, substitution and addition lines. Here we compile information that may facilitate decision making for wheat breeders aiming to transfer resistance to biotic constraints from rye to elite wheat germplasm.KeywordsWheat breedingDiseaseInsectMiteNematodeSubstitutionTranslocationBackgroundThe use of rye chromatin in wheat\n                Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) provides about 20% of the calories in the diet of the human population. Augmenting its productivity is a global task of paramount importance. The demand for this crop is increasing at a higher rate than its production, and at the same time there is also a great need for producing it without compromising the environment. Plant breeding, in combination with environmentally friendly production systems with increased efficiency are required to meet the demands [1].\n                Wheat yields are constrained by several stresses, biotic and abiotic. To counteract them, plant breeders continuously try to incorporate new resistance/tolerance traits in new cultivars by making use of the inherent diversity of domesticated wheat and also of its related species. One of the most widely used wheat relatives in this effort is rye (Secale cereale L.). Genes from rye have been incorporated in wheat in the form of substitution and translocation lines. Indeed, several studies show chromosome 1R to contribute a yield advantage in wheat (e.g. [2–4]).\n                The first attempts to hybridize wheat and rye can be traced back to the experiments conducted by Stephen Wilson, presented in 1873 [5]. Although he considered his results to be negative, he stated that the failure could have been caused by improper methods. The first stable amphiploid triticale (Triticosecale Wittmack) is attributed to Rimpau in 1888, and thereafter more efforts were put into producing wheat-rye hybrids. The advent of colchicine treatment and tissue culture at the beginning of the twentieth century greatly facilitated the production of triticales [6].\n                Historically, mainly four rye sources have been used to incorporate rye chromatin in wheat, deployed as (1B)1R substitution or 1BL.1RS and 1AL.1RS translocation lines. The first and most widely deployed source is 1R from Petkus rye. Genotypes with 1BL.1RS translocations were first developed in Germany by Riebesel via extensive crossings between wheat and rye, and such a translocation from Petkus became ancestor of wheat cultivars released in Western Europe, Russia, Mexico, Chile and other countries. From triticale, it is possible to develop wheat germplasm with chromosomes or chromosome arms exchanged for rye chromatin. The other three historic sources for cultivar development were of that kind, developed in Japan, Germany and USA [7].\n                Between 1960 and 1990, several hundreds of cultivars with (1B)1R substitution, or 1BL.1RS and 1AL.1RS translocations were released. At the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), 60% of the wheat descendants were 1BL.1RS genotypes during the 1990’s [7]. In China, about 40% of the wheat cultivars released between 1960 and 2000 were 1B/1R translocations with yield gains over the years partly attributed to this characteristic [4]. There are no recent surveys published on the proportion of wheat cultivars with rye chromatin. However, Schlegel [8] has compiled a worldwide list of 2470 wheat cultivars and experimental lines that carry alien introgressions. According to such information and the cultivar listing by the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants [9], we could estimate that there are countries such as Chile in which 34% of the commercial varieties released between 2000 and 2013 carry rye introgressions. In other UPOV countries this percentage is as low as 1–2%, for instance in Russia and Australia. In the USA, according to the database of the Journal of Plant Registrations (http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/pvp/pvplist.pl?) and Schlegel’s compilation, the percentage of commercial varieties carrying rye chromatin is about 15%. These examples demonstrate how the current importance of rye introgressions in wheat varies between countries.\n                Partly due to new pathotypes of stem and yellow rusts invading wheat at large scale, in Africa, northern Europe and China, there is renewed interest in using rye as a source for new resistance genes in wheat. Here we compile historic and more recent information on resistance to biotic stresses transferred from rye to wheat.\n              Transfer of rye chromatin to wheatWheat, T. aestivum (2n=6x=42), originates from the Near East. It is composed of three genomes (A, B and D) from three diploid ancestors. Donors of the A and D genomes are relatives of Triticum urartu Tumanian ex Gandilyan and Aegilops tauschii Coss., respectively. The origin of the B genome is not completely clarified, but certain evidence points out Aegilops speltoides Tausch as the relative of the donor. Hexaploid wheat originates from the hybridization of Triticum turgidum L. (AABB) and A. taushii (DD) relatives. Despite its polyploid nature, wheat shows a diploid-like behavior with preferential pairing between homologous chromosomes during meiosis [10–12].Rye, S. cereale (2n=2x=14), is a diploid species that also originates from the Near East [13]. The chromosome groups 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of wheat are essentially homoelogous with 1R, 2R, 3R, 5R and 6R chromosomes of rye, and 4 and 7 of wheat have partial reciprocal homoeology with groups 4R and 7R [14].The allopolyploid nature of wheat makes it highly tolerant to modifications in its genetic composition. The homoeologous pairing between rye and wheat allows the introduction of desirable agronomic characteristics in wheat from rye such as resistance to certain pests and diseases and tolerance to various abiotic stresses. Additionally, the buffering capability of wheat for tolerating important modifications in its genome has allowed the development of different genetic stocks consisting of monosomic, telocentric, deletion and nullisomic lines. These types of plant material have played a significant role in genetic research, for instance in the determination of physical locations for various molecular markers and genes [15, 16].The transfer of a target chromosome to be incorporated in wheat can be done by selecting an adequate aneuploid wheat line and cross it with rye or a previously developed amphiploid, in this particular case triticale. Wheat-alien substitution lines are frequently used as bridges to produce wheat-alien translocation lines [10, 16, 17].Another strategy to obtain translocation lines is to recover spontaneous wheat-rye translocations that occur due to the centromeric breakage and fusion of the chromosome arms. Chromosomes tend to break at the centromeres during meiotic metaphase I forming telocentrics. Different telocentrics may fuse again, and thereby exchange chromosome segments [17, 18].Inducing random translocations by irradiation methods in the absence of homoeologous pairing of substitution lines is yet another strategy, although this method can be laborious and cause several deleterious effects [19]. The winter wheat cultivar Amigo with the 1AL.1RS translocation was developed with this method [20], although doubts have been expressed whether this centric translocation was caused by the irradiation treatment [16].It is also possible to obtain translocation lines with the procedure described by Lapitan et al. [21], in which the embryos of the wheat-rye hybrids are grown in tissue culture on a medium with enhanced auxin concentration to stimulate callus formation. Recovered plants are colchicine treated for chromosome doubling. With this procedure the generation of translocation lines is facilitated by the tissue culture step in which different structural changes in the chromosomes occur. Lines produced with this method were identified to carry 4DL.1RS, 2BS.2RL and 2BL.3R translocations [21, 22].Another strategy is by using a ph1b mutant of wheat. The functional Ph1 allele in chromosome 5B inhibits homoeologous pairing between wheat and alien chromosomes whereas the mutant allows pairing and recombination between homoeologues. Thus it is possible to reduce the amount of genetic material introduced from the alien species [10, 17]. However translocation break points between homoeologous chromosomes are mostly concentrated to the distal parts of the chromosomes [23].Yet another strategy to induce homoeologous pairing between rye and wheat chromosomes is to expose tillers to okadaic acid before cells enter into meiosis phase. This will induce early condensation of chromatin, which is associated with the phenotype of ph1 mutants. When applying optimal concentrations of okadaic acid, homoeologous pairing can take place even in the presence of the Ph1 allele [24].Many Chinese wheat cultivars have Kr alleles which make them easily crossable with rye, something which has been used in more recent efforts to create new 1BL.1RS translocation lines [25, 26].Rye as a source of resistance to biotic stresses in wheatRye is well documented as a rich source of resistance to pests and pathogens in wheat. Most of its desirable characteristics have been found in chromosome 1R. Nonetheless, resistance is conferred to wheat from the incorporation of other rye chromosomes as well. However, we found no reports on this from chromosome 7R and just one report, on aphid resistance, from chromosome 5R [27]. One advantage of transferring rye chromatin into wheat is that if multiple resistances to various diseases/pests are present in the rye chromosome of interest, the rye chromatin is inherited as a block when crossing with wheat. On the other hand it can be disadvantageous if the rye source confers undesirable traits, and thus makes it necessary to reduce the alien segments.Resistance to diseases\n                Various rye sources incorporated in wheat have been reported to confer resistance to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Erikss.), yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis var. striiformis Westend), stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Erikss. and E. Henn.), and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis [DC.] f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal) (Table 1).Table 1\n                        Resistance to biotic stresses transferred from rye into wheat\n                       Rye chromosome\n                              1R\n                            \n                              2R\n                            \n                              3R\n                            StressGeneaDescriptionGermplasmGeneDescriptionGermplasmGeneDescriptionGermplasm\n                              Puccinia triticina\n                            \n                              Lr26\n                            1BL.1RSPetkus rye;

[26] unless: badditional with temporary designation or ND no designation\n                    \n                Chromosome 1R from Petkus rye has been the most deployed of the rye resistance sources over the years since the 1960’s. This has conferred resistance to several important diseases of wheat. It carries Lr26, Yr9, Sr31 and Pm8 resistance genes for leaf rust, yellow rust, stem rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Unfortunately, diseases are able to overcome major race-specific resistance genes like these. However, one remarkable case is the resistance gene Sr31 from Petkus rye that remained effective against stem rust for more than 30 years. When found defeated first in Uganda in 1999 [28], this posed a major threat to global wheat production because a great proportion of cultivars worldwide carried this gene [29].\n                Apart from Petkus rye and the wheat cultivars with the 1BL.1RS translocation derived from this source, like Kavkaz and Veery, there are several other 1R sources of resistance to diseases. Insave rye deployed as 1AL.1RS chromatin in Amigo wheat carry stem rust resistance gene Sr1RS\n                           Amigo\n                   and powdery mildew resistance gene Pm17, allelic to Pm8, and Imperial rye provides stem rust resistance gene Sr50/SrR. In China there are many recent attempts to transfer new yellow rust resistance from rye sources, such as that from dwarf rye R12 with temporary gene designation YrR212, a 1BL.1RS translocation giving recessive yellow rust resistance from the 1BL.1RS source SW1862 and Aigan rye contributing a non-designated YR gene. Also in China, there are now breeding lines and cultivars with 1RS derived from Petkus rye but with other alleles than Yr9 and Pm8, temporarily designated as YrCn17 and PmCn17. Since rye is out-crossing, there may be such within-cultivar allelic variation [25] (Table 1).\n                There are less cases of disease resistance in source chromosomes other than 1R. However, from 2R there are two designated genes for leaf rust resistance, Lr25 and Lr45, and one stem rust resistance gene, Sr59, giving resistance to many stem rust races including Ug99. The 2BS.2RL-SLU source gives resistance to leaf rust, stem rust and powdery mildew. In 2R introgressions there are three more cases of powdery mildew resistance, one of which has gene designation Pm7. Lr25 and Pm7 are derived from the same rye source, Rosen. In 3R only the gene Sr27 for stem rust resistance has been reported so far, from the rye cultivar Imperial. Furthermore, there is powdery mildew resistance in 4R and 6R, from Kustro and German white rye, and in 6R from Prolific rye with gene designation Pm20 (Table 1). Rahmatov et al. [30] investigated a large set of rye introgression lines in spring and winter wheat for resistance to several virulent races of stem rust and found (1D) 1R, (2D) 2R, (3D) 3R substitution or translocation lines likely to carry new resistance genes. The same large set of rye introgression lines was also tested for yellow rust resistance, with promising results in terms of resistance from hitherto unexploited triticale origin [31].\n                Even though rye chromatin with resistance genes is present, such genes may not be expressed due to the presence of suppressors in wheat. There are leaf rust resistance suppressors reported in the three genomes of hexaploid wheat [32]. Suppression of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm8 is reported to be associated with Pm3 alleles located in the 1A chromosome. Initially the hypothesis was that the gliadin loci Gli-A1 and Gli-A3 were suppressing Pm8. Later, when the gene Pm3 was cloned and shown to be closely linked to the gliadin locus, its role in Pm8 suppression became evident as a post-translational process [33–37].\n                The gene Pm8 has been reported to give different virulence/avirulence patterns in different countries. For instance in Hungary it appears to be ineffective [38] whereas in Norway it is more effective than in China [39].\n              Resistance to pests\n                There are several examples where genes from rye confer resistance to some of the most important wheat pests; like the aphids Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), Rhopalosiphum padi L. and Sitobion avenae (F.); the cecidomyid Mayetiola destructor (Say); the nematodes Heterodera avenae (Wollenweber) and Heterodera filipjevi (Madzhidov) Stelter; and the mite Aceria tosichell Keifer (Table 1).\n                One of the first reports of transferring resistance to insects from rye into wheat is the resistance gene Gb2 effective against certain biotypes of S. graminum. This gene originates from the chromosome 1RS of Insave rye and is present in the winter wheat cultivar Amigo. The Gb2 gene confers resistance to biotypes B, C and J of S. graminum. However, likely due to the presence of high S. graminum genetic diversity in nature, the Gb2 resistance gene became ineffective in cultivated wheat. Another resistance gene was reported later, Gb6, which also originates from the 1RS chromosome arm of Insave rye and this is in addition effective against biotypes E, G, I and K. The S. graminum biotypes E and I are currently the most commonly found biotypes in wheat crops in the USA and cause a greater yield loss than the other biotypes [40–42].\n                Another important example of insect resistance from rye is the gene Dn7 for D. noxia resistance. This gene originates from the 1RS chromosome arm of Turkey 77 rye. In the USA, D. noxia was first found in 1986, and only one biotype prevailed until 2003 when a new biotype designated as biotype 2 appeared in wheat [43]. Only Dn7 is effective to biotype 2 of all the known Dn genes. Many additional D. noxia biotypes have been found since then, and presently there is no known effective resistance in wheat to biotype 3 of D. noxia [44, 45]. Resistance to D. noxia in Syria was localized to rye introgressions (1D) 1R, 3DL.3RS and (5D) 5R, but so far without gene designations [27].\n                Centromeric breakage-fusion and the utilization of ph1 mutants were exploited by Lukaszewski [23, 46–50], Lukaszewski et al. [51] and Zhang et al. [52] to produce and analyze various substitution, translocation and recombinant lines from different sources of rye in the background of the spring wheat cultivar Pavon F76. Out of this set of 61 lines, certain 1R or 1RS lines from two triticale sources, Panda and Presto, show seedling resistance to both of aphid species R. padi and S. avenae. It is not known as yet whether resistance is conferred by the same or different rye genes. One line with 1RS from Amigo wheat was resistant to S. avenae both at seedling and adult plant stage.\n                Another rye gene in Amigo wheat, Cmc3 in 1AL.1RS, gives resistance to the mite A. tosichell. Furthermore, resistance to the cecidomyid M. destructor has been found in 2RL and 6RL and gene designations have been made as H21 and H25, respectively. Resistance to the nematodes H. filipjevi and H. avenae has been reported in 6R wheat derives (Table 1).\n              Examples of other traits affected by rye chromatin in wheatDepending on the wheat genetic background, the rye source and the type of abiotic stress factors, studies have shown that rye transferred into wheat may have both positive and negative effects on wheat performance. Hoffman [53] and Waines and Ehdaie [54] have reported 1RS to promote root biomass growth. Karki et al. [55] concluded that the 1BL.1RS translocation is more suited to withstand moisture limitations compared to 1AL.1RS or 1DL.1RS. However, Monneveux et al. [56] have reported that 1BL.1RS negatively impacts yield when wheat is grown under rainfed conditions and heat stress, depending on the wheat background. It is possible that these differences in performance may be due to the presence of suppressors in wheat as is the case in relation to certain diseases.Kim et al. [3] tested different rye sources of 1R in the genetic background of the spring wheat cultivar Pavon F76. They concluded that it is important to consider which 1RS source is to be transferred into wheat, whereas a favourable 1RS confers higher yield regardless of which wheat chromosome, 1A, 1B or 1D, it is translocated into. However, the position of 1RS in the wheat genome can negatively affect baking quality, and genotypes 1AL.1RS are preferred over 1BL.1RS and 1DL.1RS in this respect [57].Additional traits that can potentially be exploited are aluminum and acid soil tolerance. It is known that rye possesses tolerance to these soil conditions in chromosomes 3R, 4R and 6R. However, presence of gene suppressors in the wheat genome may hamper full expression of these traits [58]. Furthermore, there are loci in chromosomes 1R and 7R that can increase wheat zinc efficiency [59] and loci in 5RL that increase copper efficiency [60]. Allelopathic effect on weeds is another favorable trait of rye chromatin in wheat, predominantly found in 1R and 2R substitutions [61].ConclusionsPlant breeders are continuously trying to find new sources for resistance that can be transferred into elite wheat germplasm. To find and transfer resistance genes that are effective against a wide range of strains of the key pathogen is ideal. Furthermore, it is desirable that those durable resistance genes are also effective against other pathogens, and other pests. Genes giving these plant characteristics have only been found in hexaploid wheat so far. For instance Lr34 and Lr67 leaf rust resistance genes provide pleiotropic effects on powdery mildew, yellow rust and stem rust [62–64]. However, the information we present here facilitates decision making in terms of combining resistances from different wheat-rye derived lines into a single wheat genotype. Primarily, we expect breeders to use existing rye introgressions in wheat. However, with improved materials and methods for making introgressions, and molecular tools for detection of rye chromatin in wheat, we expect also new introgression lines to be developed and used in wheat breeding.DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsThe authors thank the funding agencies for support.\n                Funding\n                Monsanto’s Beachell-Borlaug International Scholars Program, FORMAS, Sida and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences provided financial support.\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                Not applicable.\n              \n                Authors’ contributions\n                LAC-H wrote the main part of the review, LG-G edited the review and IÅ coordinated the writing process, updated and made the final editing of the review.

Mutational mechanisms underlying such kind of genetic variations have been extensively investigated in diverse organisms. However, obscure impact of ploidization, an evolutionary process of genome content duplication prevails mostly in plants, on non-coding DNA is poorly understood.\n              \n                Results\n                Genome sequences of diversely originated plant species were examined for genome-wide motif imperfection pattern, and various analytical tools were employed to canvass characteristic relationships among repeat density, imperfection and length of microsatellites. Moreover, comparative genomics approach aided in exploration of microsatellites conservation footprints in Gossypium evolution. Based on our results, motif imperfection in repeat length was found intricately related to genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites among 13 genomes. Microsatellite decay estimation depicted slower decay of long motif repeats which led to predominant abundance of 5-nt repeat motif in Gossypium species. Short motif repeats exhibited rapid decay through the evolution of Gossypium lineage ensuing drastic decrease of 2-nt repeats, of which, “AT” motif type dilapidated in cultivated tetraploids of cotton.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                The outcome could be a directive to explore comparative evolutionary footprints of simple non-coding genetic elements i.e., repeat elements, through the evolution of genus-specific characteristics in cotton genomes.\n              Keywords\n                Gossypium\n              MicrosatellitesMotif imperfectionComparative genomicsEvolutionBackgroundMicrosatellites are DNA structural elements in which a short sequence pattern (motif) is repeated by various numbers and ubiquitously presented in genomes of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Various mechanisms like replication slippage, unequal crossover, realignment after disassociation of replicating strands, mispairing and base substitution are causative to variations which ultimately lead to extensive polymorphism in microsatellites [1, 2]. Replication slippage events are majorly responsible for extensive repeat length variations, and mispairing of replication strands is key determinant for base substitution in DNA sequence [3]. Moreover, stable wobble mispairing and inefficiency of mismatch repair system could incorporate point mutations anywhere in genome sequence [4]. These processes could impinge on microsatellites and generate repeats with occasional mismatch, motif imperfection, in their repeat units.During the replication process, insertion or deletion in repeat motif units due to reduced strand specificity or slippage errors could generate length variations. Various models comprehend and illustrate the mechanism of replication slippage event [5]. A single unit repeat is inserted or deleted at a time according to stepwise mutation model [6], while repeat unit variations were found associated to a distinct probability distribution under specific assumptions [7]. Similarly, another model proposed generation of microsatellites as 3' extension of retrotransposons in a way similar to polyadenylation of mRNA [8]; while, idea of probable generation and insertion of microsatellites in 5' region and inside the mobile elements further extended the model [9]. On contrary, the mechanisms underlying mispairing and interruptions leading to single nucleotide changes are poorly understood [10].Non-coding DNA elements, including microsatellites, also experience various evolutionary forces and show high mutation rates (10-2 – 10-6) in response to selection forces as these usually go unnoticed [11]. Thus, higher mutability and hyper variability of microsatellites could be key determinants of a dynamic equilibrium state in which rapid loss or conservation of non-coding DNA elements exist in species among or within a clade [12]. Various studies reported microsatellite conservation over longer time [13], and recently a study reported conservation up to 450 million years ago (MYA) in vertebrates [14]. Similarly, evolutionary forces might regulate the mechanism which drives fate determination processes of non-coding or coding DNA elements. Thus, conservation and/or deterioration of DNA structural elements over a geographic time period determine impact of species-evolving processes like speciation, diversification, domestication and even duplication through polidization in plant genomes.Non-coding elements constitute a major proportion of DNA in all forms of life and play a crucial role in modulating coding regions of DNA. Occurrence and applicability of microsatellites in coding sequence (CDS) have elucidated their functional importance [15]. Since microsatellites are implied to regulate biological functions [16], mutations in coding microsatellites could be informative and even point mutation might induce deleterious effects. However, our brief understandings about mechanisms underlying motif imperfection, either through base substitutions or point mutation, cause an eminent impediment in this regard.In this report, genome-wide motif imperfection pattern were discerned in 13 plant genomes of diverse origins. The relationship between repeat length and degree of motif imperfection with its impact on the genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites was determined, particularly for Gossypium species. Moreover, evolutionary patterns of microsatellite conservation and/or loss among Gossypium species were also established to ascertain structural consequences of whole genome duplication and allopolypolidization events through evolution of cultivated cotton tetraploids.MethodsGenome assemblies of 13 plant species\n                The genome sequences of thirteen plant species were investigated comprising ten dicots and three monocots. The dicot species belonged to family Brassicaceae (Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa), Fabaceae (Glycine max and Phaseolus vulgaris), Salicaceae (Populus trichocarpa) and majorly to Malvaceae (Gossypium arboreum, G. raimondii, G. hirsutum, G. barbadence and Theobroma cacao). The three monocots belonged to family Poaceae (Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa and Zea mays). In addition, coding sequences of annotated genes were also searched for imperfect repeats among four Gossypium species. The genome assemblies and CDS sequences of Gossypium species were retrieved from Cottongen [17], while genome sequences of other nine plant species were obtained from NCBI Genome Portal [18]. The name of each species was abbreviated to four letters where first capital letter denoted to genus and trailing three letters as species name.\n              Imperfect microsatellites identification\n                The SciRoKo (v3.4) program utility [19] was used with default imperfect search parameters to identify imperfect microsatellites of varying motif length from 1 to 6 nucleotide (nt) that were designated as 1-nt, 2-nt, 3-nt, 4-nt, 5-nt and 6-nt among 13 plant genomes. Imperfect search criteria regarding repeat length and mismatch penalty were modified, as previously described [20]. Maximum number of successive mismatch was set to ‘3’, and minimum repeat length was set to 15 nt. Compound microsatellites were excluded where maximum distance for association between two repeats was less than 100 nt. For motif standardization, each microsatellite motif underwent a two-step complete standardization procedure. In the first step, repeat motifs like “AG” and “GA” were all categorized as “AG” and termed as partially standardized motifs. Subsequently, in the second step, reverse complement sequence of motifs was determined and all microsatellites were assigned to completely standardized motifs. Eventually, motifs like “AG”, “GA”, “TC” and “CT” were all designated to a single group “AG”” for further analysis. Such complete motif standardization resulted in 2, 4, 10, 33, 102 and 350 group categories for 1-nt, 2-nt, 3-nt, 4-nt, 5-nt and 6-nt repeat motifs, respectively.\n              Motif imperfection and repeat length analyses\n                The genomic abundance of imperfect repeats was ascertained with varying mismatch counts and repeat lengths. Initially, short length repeats were selected and motif imperfection was employed to discriminate between perfect (with no mismatch) and imperfect microsatellites (with mismatch >0) among all genomes. It was noticed that loci with repeat length < 20 nt did not carry mismatch, thus were excluded from further analysis. While, repeats <25 nt had only ‘1’ mismatch per locus and there were up to ‘2’ mismatch in repeat loci <30 nt. The two datasets were mined separately, one having genomic abundance of microsatellites with ‘0’ or ‘1’ mismatch (no or low degree imperfection). While, other comprised of exactly ‘1’ or ‘2’ mismatch (low or higher degree imperfection) for repeats of length 20 to 24 nt (dataset I) and 25 to 29 nt (dataset II), respectively.\n                Thereafter, three different analytical strategies were employed. Firstly, principal coordinates method [21] was used to conduct generalized discriminant analysis on both datasets separately. The analysis generated canonical axes scores which were used to determine correlation among the variables, and statistical significance was estimated by permutation (n = 9999) method implemented in ‘CAP’ program [22]. Moreover, the R package [23] was also used to test the significance of canonical correlations by add-on package ‘CCP’ [24]. Secondly, longer microsatellites of length 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 and 80 nt were targeted with different levels of imperfection (1, 2, 3 and 4 mismatch per loci). The relationships between motif imperfection and varied length repeats were estimated using permutational analysis of variance PERMANOVA [25] by calling “adonis” function under package vegan [26], and statistical significance of F-statistic was measured (0.05) after permutations (n = 999) in R environment. Thirdly, the genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites was related to mismatch counts and repeat length through t-statistic and significant difference were determined (0.05). A linear regression model was fitted to mismatch count and repeat length in each Gossypium species.\n              Transposable elements (TEs) distribution of perfect vs imperfect microsatellites\n                Perfect (no mismatch) and imperfect repeats (mismatch =1) were compared for relatedness to nearby intact TEs. Each chromosome was considered as independent segment, and TEs abundance was determined among the four cotton genomes in vicinity of microsatellites (500 nt flanked region on both sides) for both sets of repeats. Then, a linear regression model was fitted to the repeat density and TEs abundance in each Gossypium species.\n              Motif imperfection in coding region of Gossypium species\n                Annotated coding sequences were searched for imperfect repeats under default criteria. All publically available annotated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers sequences [17] for cotton genomes were downloaded and employed for functional characterization of imperfect microsatellites in coding region.\n              Microsatellites conservation among Gossypium species\n                For conservation analysis, microsatellite libraries were developed separately for each species containing repeats flanked with 350 nt on both sides. Because of the drawbacks pertained to sequencing homo-polymers, 1-nt repeats were excluded. Moreover, all compound and overlapping sequences were filtered out and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to validate uniqueness of each locus by NCBI BLAST 2.2.31 [27] through self-BLASTing each library and discarding false positives. A custom perl script was used to hard mask repeat sequences for each locus, and genome to sub-genome (diploid vs sub-diploid in tetraploids) BLAST searches was conducted among libraries. The output was filtered for algorithms like alignment =50% of query cover, identity =70% and E_value 10-10. Since a whole genome duplication (WGD) event was reported through cotton tetraploids’ evolution [28], duplication of each progenitor loci was allowed up to two physical positions for pair wise comparisons (A2 vs AT & D5 vs DT) among homologous chromosomes. The results were validated in reciprocal BLAST searches. Thereafter, conserved microsatellites proportion was employed to develop an intuitive diagram for genome-wide microsatellite conservation by motif size using circos tool [29].\n              Estimate of microsatellite decay during paleopolyploidization\n                The WGD event involved through paleopolyploidization of cultivated tetraploid species was estimated with varied divergence time [30]. A representative median divergence time as ~6 MYA was used. Assuming steady loss of microsatellite loci over the period of divergence time, an exponential fitted decay function was employed to estimate “comparative exponential decay” of microsatellite in G. hirsutum and G. barbadence. On contrary, the “relative decay” estimates of varying motif repeats in tetraploids were determined by comparing proportion of conserved repeats. Thereafter, “relative decay” and “comparative exponential decay” were fitted to an exponential decay function. All non-parametric test statistics were measured and tested for significance (0.05) in R environment.\n              Microsatellite relative abundance\n                The repeat density patterns in cotton diploids exploited evolutionary footprints regarding impact of paleopolyploidization event on it in three different ways. Firstly, proportional abundance of microsatellites in diploid and tetraploid Gossypium species was estimated by comparing their relative abundance in T. cacao, a close relative belong to Malvaceae. Secondly, the relative abundance of microsatellites according to motif kind and size in four cotton genomes was determined individually. And lastly, comparative abundance of standardized 2-nt motif was analyzed in four cotton genomes. All non-parametric test statistics were measured and tested for significance (0.05) in R environment.\n              ResultsFrequency and distribution of microsatellites among monocots and dicots\n                Microsatellite distribution of varying motif length (1–6 nt) was examined in ten dicots and three monocots. Generally, 2-nt and 3-nt repeats were found in higher percentage in dicots and monocots (Table 1), respectively. While, Atha exhibited almost equal proportion of three motifs (1–3 nt). A plentiful abundance of 3-nt microsatellite was observed in Osat (33.67%) and the trend persisted among Bdis and Zmay. Among dicots, the proportion of 2-nt repeats prevailed and Brap featured the highest proportion of it (39.67%). However, frequency of 5-nt microsatellites predominated and featured specific to four Gossypium genomes. Reckoning to the four cotton genomes, a drastic reduction in percentage of 2-nt repeats was observed in tetraploids (Ghir and Gbar) up to 11.95%. While, density of microsatellites with short motif repeats decreased, those with longer motifs (4–6 nt) exhibited incessant abundance in tetraploids compared to their progenitors (Table 1).Table 1\n                        Microsatellite distribution as percent motif abundance (%) among 13 plant genomes\n                      SpeciesAbbreviationMono- (1-nt)Di- 2-nt)Tri- (3-nt)Tetra- (4-nt)Penta- (5-nt)Hexa- (6-nt)\n                              A. thaliana\n                            Atha24.0522.4824.487.3615.296.33\n                              B. rapa\n                            Brap8.7739.6818.4410.1216.086.91\n                              G. arboreum\n                            Garb10.0222.0214.9014.1228.9310.01\n                                            G. barbadence\n                                          Gbar6.4311.9517.1218.7433.0512.72\n                              G. hirsutum\n                            Ghir3.7211.9517.5819.3134.3713.07\n                                            G. raimondii\n                                          Grai6.8919.7814.7817.8529.8810.82\n                              P. trichocarpa\n                            Ptri14.8227.0519.2212.5316.848.54\n                              G. max\n                            Gmax12.5832.5417.8811.6218.607.79\n                              P. vulgaris\n                            Pvul3.9430.6020.9014.0020.3510.20\n                              T. cacao\n                            Tcac12.9532.6016.9212.5419.235.76\n                              O. sativa\n                            Osat5.0221.0333.6713.0217.1210.15\n                              B. distachyon\n                            Bdis9.4911.9930.2518.1020.9411.51\n                              Z. mays\n                            Zmay6.1619.5528.3913.4520.669.51\n                Our data depicted differential variations in repeat density (per Mb) and frequencies of imperfect microsatellites related to genome sizes among 13 plant genomes (Additional file 1: Table S1). Density of imperfect microsatellites varied from 15.61 to 49.07%, and an eminent variation pattern was observed in monocots compared to dicots. Lower repeat density was noticed for species with genome sizes bigger than 1 Gb (109 bases) like Zmay, Ghir, Gbar and Garb and the trend persisted except for Bdis. All species depicted differential variations in imperfection percentage, and species belonging to same genus (Gossypium) exhibited varied extent of imperfection. Moreover, differential variations in frequency of imperfect microsatellites was observed among chromosomes of 13 genomes (Additional file 2: Table S2). The four Gossypium species contained substantial variations among cognate homologous chromosomes.\n              Motif imperfection and repeat length relationship\n                The average length of imperfect microsatellites increased over perfect ones among 13 plant species (Additional file 3: Table S3). Based on significant canonical variations observed for both datasets (dataset I and II), the genomic abundance of microsatellites was found related to variations in repeat length and motif imperfection. The results showed a significant relationship between perfect and ‘1’ mismatch repeats where first squared canonical correlation to be 0.958 (p = 0.0002). Likewise, a significant canonical correlation was determined with first squared canonical variation to be 0.926 (p = 0.0008) for dataset II in which ‘1’ and ‘2’ mismatch repeats of varied lengths (25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 nt) were included. In dataset I, ‘1’ mismatch repeats explained lesser canonical variation while ‘2’ mismatch repeats commuted in dataset II (Fig. 1). These findings affirmed that repeat length and motif imperfection were somehow modulated in subordinated ways.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Frequency variations of various mismatch repeats among 10 dicot [A. thaliana (Atha), B. rapa (Brap), G. arboreum (Garb), G. barbadence (Gbar), G. hirsutum (Ghir), P. trichocarpa (Ptri), G. max (Gmax), P. vulgaris (Pvul) and T. cacao (Tcac)] and 3 monocots [(O. sativa (Osat), B. distachyon (Bdis) and Z. mays (Zmay)] shown as stacked bar graphs. Frequency variations of length repeats (20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 nt) harboring (a) no mismatch or (b) exactly ‘1’ mismatch were presented and (c) canonical axes plotted as scatter plot. While frequency variations of length repeats (25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 nt) which contained (d) exactly ‘1’ mismatch or (e) exactly ‘2’ mismatch presented and (f) canonical axes plotted as scatter plot\n                      \n                Degree of motif imperfection (mismatch count) could be another factor whose relationship with repeat length might determine genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites. Outcome of PERMANOVA analysis suggested a significant relationship among mismatch count, repeat length and frequency of imperfect microsatellites. The variation in genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites was significantly related to repeat length (F = 8.050, p = 0.0029) and motif imperfection (F = 1.495, p = 0.0055). These findings speculated existence of an evolutionary mechanism which determined length and motif heterogeneity of microsatellites and the pattern prevailed among the studied set of genomes.\n                Pair-wise Pearson correlation estimates were calculated by controlling motif imperfection (Additional file 4: Table S4a-b) for different repeat lengths (35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 and 75 nt). The results established strong relationships among different length microsatellites carrying varying mismatch (Table 2). Genomic abundance of ‘1’ mismatch repeats was found more related to ‘2’ mismatch repeats, and the relationship maintained with ‘3’ mismatch repeats. The scenario became more stringent for pair-wise comparisons between ‘2’ mismatch and ‘3’ mismatch repeats. Thus, the genomic abundance of loci with lower degree of imperfection (1 mismatch) was related to varying repeat lengths. Moreover, repeats with low imperfection (1 mismatch) seemed to modulate genomic abundance of repeats with moderate imperfection (2 mismatch). Similarly, repeats with higher imperfection (3 mismatch) were more inflected by repeats which entertained ‘2’ mismatch. These findings suggested a significant role of motif imperfection in determining length of repeats.Table 2\n                        Pair-wise correlation (Pearson) estimates for imperfect microsatellites\n                      Repeat length (nt)Mismatch 1 vsmismatch 2Mismatch 1 vsmismatch 3Mismatch 2 vsmismatch 330 nt0.9830.9210.95235 nt0.9190.9190.97140 nt0.9110.8070.89445 nt\n                              0.493\n                            0.6400.76350 nt0.7670.5450.82155 nt0.6950.6990.82260 nt0.5580.6050.64365 nt0.8680.7420.77470 nt0.7760.629\n                              0.423\n                            75 nt0.896\n                              0.415\n                            \n                              0.492\n                            80 nt0.7420.8520.867\n                      The repeat length presented different lengths while frequencies of repeats harbored 1 mismatch (low imperfection), 2 mismatch (moderate imperfection) and 3 mismatch (high imperfection) were compared among 13 plant species. All estimates were significant while underlined were non-significant at 0.05\n                    \n              Motif imperfection in Gossypium genomes\n                To draw deep insights into evolutionary footprints, subsets of mismatched repeats in four Gossypium species were considered for following analyses. Linear regression between repeat length and motif imperfection was determined and a prominent relationship was observed in each case (Fig. 2), but with varied degree of variation accounted in the model (Additional file 5: Table S5).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        The mismatch (count) and repeat length relationship split among Gossypium species. Average mismatch of each standardized motif was compared to their average repeat length (nt) in Garb (G. arboreum), Grai (G. raimondii), Ghir (G. hirsutum) and Gbar (G. barbadence)\n                      \n                The genomic abundance of intact TEs was determined in 500 nt flanking region (both sides) of perfect and mismatched microsatellites (Additional file 6: Table S6). The two sets of repeats were compared for relatedness between repeat frequency and intact TEs, and significant relationships were observed (Additional file 7: Figure S1a-d). Generally, fewer TEs were observed in Grai and DT sub-genomes; while, higher abundance of TEs discerned for Garb and AT sub-genomes of tetraploids. Moreover, imperfect repeats were more colligated to genomic abundance of TEs than perfect ones except in Garb; where perfect repeats were more related than mismatched ones. This relatedness was further affirmed by Pearson correlations and significance determined at 0.05 (Table 3). Correlation values of imperfect repeats were also expectedly higher than perfect ones, but not for Garb in which perfect repeats were most likely imbedded in TEs.Table 3\n                        A comparative correlation estimates between perfect (no mismatch) and imperfect (mismatch =1) repeats along with their intact TEs in cotton genomes\n                      Genome/Sub-genomePerfect repeatsImperfect repeats\n                                            Pearson correlation\n                                            p value\n                                            Pearson correlation\n                                            p valueGarb0.9441.13E-060.7433.54E-03Grai0.6312.01E-020.8355.23E-04GhirAT0.7881.37E-030.9111.47E-05GhirDT0.6152.50E-020.9391.39E-06GbarAT0.8691.11E-040.8797.49E-05GbarDT0.6481.64E-020.8462.58E-04Ghir0.8331.23E-070.9212.63E-11Gbar0.8764.38E-090.9417.22E-13\n                      Garb = G. arboreum, Grai = G. raimondii, GhirAT =G. hirsutum A sub-genome, GhirDT = G. hirsutum D sub-genome, GbarAT = G. barbadence A sub-genome, GbarDT = G. barbadence D sub-genome, Ghir = G. hirsutum and Gbar = G. barbadence\n                                 \n                    \n                Differential abundance of imperfect repeats along with intact TEs distribution was determined among individual chromosomes. Interestingly, the frequency of imperfect microsatellites and intact TEs for all species was found at par (Additional file 6: Table S6). The higher abundance of intact TEs was observed in Garb than Grai, while vice versa was true for imperfect repeats. Chromosomes A05, A08, A10 and A11 exhibited higher density of both repeat elements, while a mixed pattern was observed for D03, D07 and D12 among tetraploids. Structural anomalies of chromosomes in two genetically distant progenitors, evolutionary processes, biased selection forces, mutations, deletions and translocations of larger DNA segments could be causative to such abrupt differentiations among tetraploids and diploids. Thus, comparative distributive pattern and its relatedness suggested more likely presence of intact TEs wherever a mismatch found in a microsatellite.\n              Motif interruptions in coding sequence\n                Coding sequences of Gossypium species were also searched for imperfection and results were summarized in Additional file 8: Table S7. Generally, tri- and hexa- motif repeats prevailed, while only tri- motif repeats accounted for >70% of microsatellites in CDS regions (Table 4). It was expected due to triplet and degenerate nature of codons. The motif imperfection in Grai repeats was elevated and slight increment in average repeat length was noticed. The tandem repeat density was reduced than genomic ones, while the higher proportion of genes in Ghir harbored repeats in exons (Additional file 8: Table S7). Overall, the motif imperfection mechanisms targeted tri- and hexa- repeats in genomic and coding sequences respectively (Additional file 9: Figure S2).Table 4\n                        Summary and characteristics of microsatellites detected in CDS region\n                      CategoryGarbaGraibGhircGbardOverall SSR density (per Mb)65.1261.7069.4857.153-nt repeat density (per Mb)44.0741.4347.7638.226-nt repeat density (per Mb)15.9515.0917.2814.99Average mismatch (Imperfection)0.250.300.250.22Average repeat length (nt)21.1522.0521.5721.19Genes with tandem repeat in CDS (n)2471284649642992Genes with mismatched motif (n)441475881698Compound microsatellites (n)71114133202\n                      \n                                    aG. arboreum (Garb), bG. raimondii (Grai), cG. hirsutum (Ghir) and dG. barbadence (Gbar)\n                    \n              Long motif repeats well conserved in Gossypium species\n                Our data showed predominant abundance of large microsatellites in Gossypium species compared to other dicots and monocots. Microsatellite conservation pattern elucidated the possible influence of paleopolyploidization event and traced out the evolutionary footprints in Gossypium species. The microsatellites proportion of each AT and DT sub-genome in two cultivated species was ascertained which retained from the progenitors (Fig. 3). The shorter repeats were found less conserved, while repeats with long motifs remained intact as in progenitor species (Additional file 10: Table S8). Among short repeats, the 2-nt microsatellites were found more deteriorated in tetraploids where Gbar retained the lowest proportion from two diploids. On the contrary, 3–6 nt repeats were more conserved, while 5-nt repeats were highly conserved (56.86–78.26%) in both tetraploids. Overall, Ghir retained higher proportion repeats from Garb (66.58%); while, slightly lower proportion retained (61.39%) from another progenitor. Since microsatellites were more deteriorated through series of evolutionary events in Gbar, thus fewer loci retained intact (37.83–43.99%).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Intuitive diagram shows conserved microsatellite proportion based on motif length. Motif repeats like 2-nt (dinucleotide), 3-nt (trinucleotide), 4-nt (tetra- nucleotide), 5-nt (penta- nucleotide) and 6-nt (hexa- nucleotide) were compared for conservation among Garb (G. arboreum), Grai (G. raimondii), Ghir (G. hirsutum) and Gbar (G. barbadence)\n                      \n              Estimation of microsatellite decay\n                The conserved microsatellite proportion and divergence time were fitted to an exponential decay function and microsatellites decay rate of varied length motifs was calculated among Gossypium species. A static decay was observed in Ghir for loci from both progenitors except 2-nt repeats; of which DT originated repeats were lost significantly faster (Friedman statistic = 48.44, p = 0.00001) (Additional file 11: Figure S3a). Whereas in Gbar, 2-nt repeats of DT origin were highly distorted and lost due to significantly faster decay (Friedman statistic = 55.083, p = 0.00001) (Additional file 11: Figure S3b). In comparison, Ghir retained higher proportion of microsatellites from diploid species than Gbar. Similarly, large motif repeats (3-6 nt) were more evolutionary stable and conserved compared to 2-nt repeats in both A-genome and D-genome of Gossypium lineage. Overall, repeats loci in Ghir depicted slower decay of repeats than Gbar (Fig. 4a), while a significant faster decay (Friedman statistic = 18.762, p = 0.0021) of Grai repeats was observed in tetraploids compared to Garb microsatellites. Considering both “relative decay” and “comparative exponential decay”, all repeat motif exhibited faster decay in Gbar than Ghir (Fig. 4b).\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Comprison of microsatellite decay between two cotton tetraploids compared to repeats originated in diploids (Garb and Grai). a Relative loss of all SSRs among AT and DT subgenomes of tetraploids (Ghir and Gbar).

The relative abundance estimates of four Gossypium species’ repeats relative to T. cacao (as of their closest phylogenetic ancestor) further substantiated the microsatellites decay pattern in Gossypium lineage (Additional file 12: Figure S4a-d). The short (1–3 nt) repeats were found less abundant in Garb (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 24.15, p = 0.0002) and Grai (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 21.68, p = 0.0006), while only 1-nt and 2-nt were drastically lost in Ghir (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 17.23, p = 0.0041) and Gbar (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 17.84, p = 0.0031). While comparing relative abundance among cotton genomes, the short repeats (1-nt and 2-nt) prevailed less (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 15.70, p = 0.0077) than longer (4-6 nt) ones (Fig. 5a). As decay rates were not determined for 1-nt repeats, thereby 2-nt repeat motif was pointed as scarcely abundant. Moreover, all 2-nt standardized motifs were lost in comparative way, while “AT” motif repeats were more rapidly lost in Ghir and Gbar (Fig. 5b). The ploidization could be a major factor for drastic loss of “AT” standardized motif as despite of ploidy increase, tetraploids conserved lower proportion of “AT” motif repeats than diploids.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Relative abundances of Gossypium microsatellite over T. cacao SSRs.

The microsatellite conservation pattern and evolutionary footprints of non-coding repetitive DNA elements were also discerned in closely related species of Malvaceae family.Genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites is well studied in simple organisms like viruses [31], mushroom [32], complex animal [33], insect [34], human [35] and even in green plants [36]. However, a clear understanding of imperfection mechanism, its role in genesis, preserving sequence variations in non-coding repeat elements and their potential impact on gene regulation are not well understood. As focus on evolution of microsatellites got reincarnated with the advent of high throughput sequencing technology [37, 38], this study emphasized on role of motif imperfection in microsatellites stability. Plant species were emphasized as microsatellites are being extensively employed in revealing diversity, heterozygosity and exploiting phenotypic variations in plants [39, 40]. Moreover, microsatellites have also been employed to unravel polyploidy in plants [41]. Evolutionary dynamics of microsatellites were revealed in genus Gossypium, a best model to investigate ploidy increase impact on microsatellite imperfection and conservation.Various tools are available for imperfect repeats search, but SciRoKo [19] was preferred since it provides a utility to efficiently digest large genome datasets into 50 Mb chunks. Moreover, assessing efficiency of various tools was beyond the scope of this study. Our results witnessed predomination of 3-nt and 2-nt repeats in monocots and dicots respectively. Many researchers have reported 3-nt repeats’ abundance as characteristics in monocots [42, 43]. Similarly, predominate abundance of 2-nt repeats has been reported in dicots [44, 45], but paramount abundance of other motifs is not out of the scope. The resultant fluctuations might be owed to variations in search parameters. Appropriate parameters were employed for imperfect microsatellites search in all studied plant genomes (Table 1 & Additional file 1: Table S1). Likewise, the distribution and abundance of imperfect repeats varied among the studied species, and it also varied among homologous chromosomes of species (Additional file 2: Table S2). Previous studies supported varied distribution of imperfect repeats among different species of genus Drosophila [46]. The trend was not affected by varying quality of 13 genome assemblies as a consistent pattern of motif imperfection was observed.The genomic abundance of imperfect microsatellites was intricately related to degree of motif imperfection and repeat length variations. Previously, repeat unit variations were found linked to repeat length and mutations [47, 48], while an equilibrium state was proposed to regulate abundance of mismatched repeats [1]. A varying stability of mismatched repeats due to sequence interruptions has been experimentally tested [49]. While, a study determined relationship between mutation and repeat units and explained why longer repeats likely to undergo contractions and short repeats experience expansion in case of slippage mutations [50]. The longer repeats (>40 nt) with no mismatch or lower imperfection (mismatch 1 and/or 2) were more abundant than those with higher degree of imperfection (Additional file 4: Table S4a-b). Moreover, a significant relationship between mismatch count and repeat length existed among Gossypium species (Additional file 5: Table S5). Generally, the longer repeats do not remain stable and immediately split to give shorter repeats as these undergo contraction. However, our results predicted longer repeats were more likely to harbor mismatch, but these repeats were less prone to contraction as motif interruptions could impart stabilizing effect to such repeats [51]. Furthermore, a low to moderate positive correlation between microsatellites and TEs was recurrently reported [52, 53] but not between imperfect microsatellites and TEs. Due to sequence interruptions, the longer repeats were found more related to TEs abundance except for Garb, where perfect repeats were more likely to be present in the vicinity of TEs (Table 3). Thus, it can be speculated that microsatellite genesis, prolonged stability, length variations and motif imperfection of mismatched repeats could be better comprehended when the replication slippage errors, polyadenylation of 5' and 3' regions of TEs are considered simultaneously.Recent studies reported that 5-nt repeats were predominated in Garb and Grai [54, 55]. However, another study reported 6-nt repeats prevailed in Ghir [56]; while our results affirmed that 5-nt repeats were consistently frequent in four sequenced Gossypium genomes. Although the different search parameters generated variations, our results were in accordance to all previous reports. Previously, phylogenetic and molecular studies have suggested that genus Gossypium diverged from close relatives during Miocene about 10–15 MYA [57]. The two progenitor diploids; G. arboreum and G. raimondii, underwent a series of rapid speciation and diversification. While allopolyploids accomplished domestication and diversified distribution in mid Pleistocene about 1–2 MYA [58]. Proportion of conserved microsatellites strongly suggested rapid loss of shorter repeats (especially 2-nt repeats) and relative abundance analysis evoked preservation of higher repeats in four sequenced cotton species. It was noted that 5-nt repeats were the second more abundant after 2-nt repeats in T. cacao. Thus, it could be speculated that through the series of evolutionary landmarks in Gossypium evolution; WGD, allopolypolidization and speciation, 2-nt repeats were drastically lost and 5-nt repeats prevailed until Gossypium early diploids evolved. The 2-nt repeat density was higher in cotton diploids than tetraploids, since the loss of shorter repeats could be a gradual process (Table 1).ConclusionThis study presented a comprehensive view of motif imperfection pattern in 13 genome assemblies representing five taxonomic families in plant kingdom. It determined the pattern of microsatellite motif imperfection and decay in complex higher plants exhibiting polyploidy and laid foundation for further studies; as plenty of plant genome sequences available to question evolutionary theory about origin of life. The results explicated evolution and stability of motif-interrupted repeats, its relationship with repeat length and its impact on their genomic prevalence in monocot and dicots. Moreover, it exploited clues to evolutionary footprints for predominate abundance of 5-nt repeats, which appeared as a characteristic in genus Gossypium. Likewise, 2-nt repeats experienced accelerated decay in Gossypium tetraploids. When compared with a close relative T. cacao, “AT” repeats started being less abundant in geographic time while Gossypium lineage was undergoing paleopolyploidization processes through the evolution of today’s domesticated cotton. Characterization of “AT” motif decay hotspots and the impact of motif decay on modulation of gene regulatory elements is mandatory to fully comprehend the basic underlying mechanisms.Abbreviations\n                BLAST: \n                    Basic local alignment search tool\n                  CDS: \n                    Coding sequences\n                  DNA: \n                    Deoxyribonucleic acid\n                  Gb: \n                    giga (109) bases\n                  Mb: \n                    mega (106) bases\n                  mRNA: \n                    messenger RNA\n                  MYA: \n                    Million years ago\n                  nt: \n                    nucleotide\n                  SNP: \n                    Single nucleotide polymorphisms\n                  SSR: \n                    Simple sequence repeats\n                  TEs: \n                    Transposable elements\n                  WGD: \n                    Whole genome duplication\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Program #31371674) for providing financial support for this work.\n                Funding\n                This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Program #31371674).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                We have provided detailed information in material and methods section of our manuscript.\n              \n                Authors’ contributions\n                ZXL and MMA both conceived the idea and designed the study.

An earlier study of the PgiC1 gene, which encodes cytosolic PGI in the grass Festuca ovina L., revealed a marked difference in the levels of nucleotide polymorphism between the 5’ and 3’ portions of the gene.\n              \n                Methods\n                In the present study, we characterized the sequence polymorphism in F. ovina PgiC1 in more detail and examined possible explanations for the non-uniform pattern of nucleotide polymorphism across the gene.\n              \n                Results\n                Our study confirms that the two portions of the PgiC1 gene show substantially different levels of DNA polymorphism and also suggests that the peptide encoded by the 3’ portion of PgiC1 is functionally and structurally more important than that encoded by the 5’ portion. Although there was some evidence of purifying selection (d\n                           N/d\n                           S test) on the 5’ portion of the gene, the signature of purifying selection was considerably stronger on the 3’ portion of the gene (d\n                           N/d\n                           S and McDonald–Kreitman tests). Several tests support the action of balancing selection within the 5’ portion of the gene. Wall’s B and Q tests were significant only for the 5’ portion of the gene. There were also marked peaks of nucleotide diversity, Tajima’s D and the d\n                           N/d\n                           S ratio at or around a PgiC1 codon site (within the 5’ portion of the gene) that a previous study had suggested was subject to positive diversifying selection.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Our results suggest that the two portions of the gene have been subject to different selective regimes. Purifying selection appears to have been the main force contributing to the relatively low level of polymorphism within the 3’ portion of the sequence. In contrast, it is possible that balancing selection has contributed to the maintenance of the polymorphism within the 5’ portion of the gene.\n              Keywords\n                Festuca ovina\n              Cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase\n                PgiC1\n              Nucleotide polymorphismPurifying selectionBackgroundLevels of nucleotide polymorphism have been shown to vary greatly between different parts of the genome (e.g. [1–3]), and there may also be variation in the levels of polymorphism within individual genes (e.g. [4–7]). A non-uniform pattern of nucleotide polymorphism within genes may arise if different types of selective pressure are operating on different regions of the gene (cf. [8, 9]). Different regions of a gene may code for peptides that have different structural or functional significances, and the regions of a gene with more stringent structural and/or functional requirements are expected to be subject to stronger purifying selection [10] and, therefore, tend to show lower levels of nucleotide polymorphism than regions that are subject to less stringent constraints [11, 12]. Positive directional selection may reduce the levels of local nucleotide polymorphism within a gene [9], while balancing selection may increase the levels of nucleotide polymorphism at, and in the vicinity of, the selected sites [13, 14]. A classic example of a case where selection results in non-uniform levels of nucleotide polymorphism between different gene regions is that of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. These genes are crucial for the ability of a vertebrate host’s immune system to detect evolving pathogens, and it is frequently suggested that the maintenance of the high levels of non-synonymous polymorphism in the MHC gene regions encoding the antigen binding site is a reflection of pathogen-driven balancing selection [15, 16]. In addition to selective processes, varying rates of recombination and mutation, as well as stochastic processes, may also contribute to non-uniform levels of nucleotide polymorphism between different regions of a gene (cf. [11, 17]).The PgiC1 gene, which encodes the cytosolic version of the metabolic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI, EC 5.3.1.9), in the grass Festuca ovina L., represents one of the few reported cases in which the levels of nucleotide polymorphism differ substantially between the 3’ and 5’ portions of a gene [18]. PGI catalyses the second step of glycolysis [19], and is also known to have diverse moonlighting functions (see the references in [20]). The functional PGI enzyme is formed by two monomers, with each monomer being composed of two main domains (the “small domain” and the “large domain”) [21, 22] (Fig. 1-a). High levels of allozyme/isozyme variation have been frequently reported for PGI in many different species [23]. Observed differences in enzyme activity between PGI variants in a number of species are consistent with observed associations between the PGI variation and environmental variables or life-history traits – suggesting that the loci coding for PGI may be under selection (e.g. [24, 25]).\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      The structure of the PgiC1 gene and the 3-D protein structure of its gene product. a PGI dimer, coded for by PgiC1, in F. ovina and homology modelled in an earlier study [34]. One monomer is shown in yellow. In the other monomer, the large domain is shown in green and the small domain is shown in dark blue. The three active site residues (equivalent to Lys516, Glu360, and His391 in F. ovina) that are directly involved in the PGI isomerization reaction are shown in red. The rest of the monomer is represented in light blue. b The gene structure is summarized for the part of the PgiC1 gene corresponding to the 1 633 bp sequence of the 29 Öland sequences characterized in the present study. Boxes represent the exons and lines represent introns. The gene structure is scaled according to an earlier published PgiC1 gene sequence (GenBank accession numbers HQ616103). The 5’ and 3’ portions (see Fig. 2) of the PgiC1 gene that are compared in the present study include, respectively, exons 1–12 and exons 13–22\n                    \n                        Festuca ovina is a perennial, tussock-forming and outcrossing grass, with wind-dispersed pollen and seeds [26]. The species has a broad ecological amplitude and is widespread in unfertilized grasslands in northern Europe (e.g. [26, 27]). The steppe-like “alvar” grasslands on the Baltic island of Öland (Sweden) are characterized by a fine-scale edaphic mosaic, with moist and dry, and high and low pH microhabitats. Earlier studies suggest that cytosolic PGI isozyme variation in F. ovina may be involved in fine-scale microhabitat adaptation on Öland [26, 28, 29]. Analysis of replicated samples from different alvar sites shows that, despite the fact that F. ovina is strongly outcrossing, the frequencies of different cytosolic PGI isozyme electromorphs are significantly associated with microhabitat variation in the alvar grasslands and that electromorph frequencies change in response to experimental habitat manipulation [26, 28].In F. ovina, cytosolic PGI is coded for by two loci, PgiC1 and PgiC2 [30]. The “native” PgiC1 locus is present in all F. ovina individuals, whereas PgiC2 is only present in some individuals and appears to have been horizontally acquired from a distantly related grass genus [29, 31–33]. Earlier analyses of the PgiC1 gene in F. ovina suggest that two PgiC1 amino acid codon sites may be affected by positive selection [34], and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) alleles at these two codon sites show significant associations with microhabitat variables in the alvar grasslands (Y Li, B Hansson, M Lönn, HC Prentice, unpublished results).The uneven distribution of polymorphic nucleotide sites along the PgiC1 gene was noted in an earlier study that included five PgiC1 coding sequences from Skåne, S Sweden [18]. The longest intron (intron 12, Fig. 1-b) was used as a demarcation point between the polymorphic 5’ portion of the gene and the, substantially less polymorphic, 3’ portion of the gene. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible evolutionary mechanisms that may have contributed to the contrasting levels of nucleotide polymorphism in the two portions of the PgiC1 gene in F. ovina. We analysed the levels of PgiC1 nucleotide polymorphism within a larger dataset (29 PgiC1 cDNA sequences) from F. ovina individuals collected from the alvar grasslands on Öland, and carried out a range of tests to assess the relative importance of different types of selection that may have contributed to the non-uniform pattern of nucleotide polymorphism within PgiC1.The 3’ portion of PgiC1 in F. ovina encodes the structurally important large domain and three functionally essential active site residues (Figs. 1-a and 2). The extensive inter-monomer interaction between the large domains of the two monomers is necessary for the formation of a stable PGI dimer [21] and the three active site residues (equivalent to Glu360, His391 and Lys516 in F. ovina) participate directly in the isomerization reaction of PGI [35]. If the 3’ portion of PgiC1 codes for products that are subject to greater structural or functional constraints than the products of the 5’ portion of the gene, then a relatively stronger level of purifying selection (i.e. negative selection) may be expected to have contributed to the low level of nucleotide polymorphism within the 3’ portion of PgiC1 in F. ovina. The 5’ portion of PgiC1 contains the amino acid codon sites 173 and 200 (Fig. 2). If these sites are under balancing selection (i.e. positive intraspecific diversifying selection), as suggested by [34], then balancing selection targeting the two sites might be expected to contribute to the high level of nucleotide polymorphism within the 5’ portion of PgiC1. The present study provides support for the prediction that there is a stronger purifying selection on the 3’ portion than on the 5’ portion of PgiC1, and suggests that there is balancing selection on the 5’ portion of the gene.\n                    \n                  Fig. 2\n                      Sliding window analyses of nucleotide diversity (p\n                                    T), Tajima’s D and <U+03C9>. The ticks on the x axis represent the boundary of each analysed PgiC1 exon within the PgiC1 coding sequence. In F. ovina, PgiC1 exons 5–12 encode the small domain of a PGI monomer while exons 13–21 encode the large domain. The two dots on the x axis show the locations of the two PgiC1 codon sites (173 and 200) that were earlier identified as being candidates for positive diversifying selection [34]. The three stars on the x axis represent the three active site residues (equivalent to Lys516, Glu360, and His391 in F. ovina) that are directly involved in the PGI isomerization reaction [35]. The grey dotted vertical line shows the location of intron 12, which is used as the demarcation point for defining the 5’ and 3’ portions of PgiC1 sequence. The brown dotted vertical line indicates codon site 200 which is under positive diversifying selection and located at or near to peaks of p\n                                    T, Tajima’s D and <U+03C9>\n                                 \n                    MethodsPlant material and sequences\n                The present study examined variation within 29 PgiC1 cDNA sequences (GenBank accession numbers KF487737-KF487765, [34]) from Öland populations of F. ovina. The sequences were derived from 15 individuals that were chosen to represent the five cytosolic PGI electromorphs (EMs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) that occur most frequently within populations of F. ovina on Öland [26, 28, 29] – with a particular focus on the two most common electromorphs, EM 1 and EM 2 [34]. The sequences were obtained by, first, synthesizing the total cDNA from the total RNA of each studied F. ovina individual [34]. The PgiC1 cDNA was then PCR-amplified from the synthesized total cDNA, and the amplified PgiC1 cDNA was cloned and sequenced [34]. Two PgiC1 cDNA alleles were acquired from each (diploid) individual, giving a total of 30 alleles from the 15 studied individuals [34]. However, one of the alleles (GenBank accession number KF487766) contained an aberrant (113 bp) insertion [34] and was excluded from the analyses in the present study, unless specified.\n                Each of the 29 analysed PgiC1 cDNA sequences covers 96% (1 633 bp) of the full-length (1701 bp, excluding stop codon) PgiC1 coding sequence, and ranges from exon 1 to exon 22 (Fig. 1-b). For comparative purposes, we also downloaded the five Skåne F. ovina PgiC1 coding sequences (GenBank accession numbers DQ225731-DQ225735) which were examined in the earlier study that noted the difference in the levels of polymorphism between the 5’ and 3’ portions of PgiC1 [18]. These five Skåne sequences represent the common cytosolic PGI isozyme electromorphs 1, 2 and 6, as well as the rare electromorph 8 [26, 28]. Each of the five sequences covers 1 182 bp, out of the full-length PgiC1 coding sequence [32], and ranges from exons 5 to 11 and from exons 13 to 21.\n              Analysis of sequence data\n                The number of polymorphic sites (S), nucleotide diversity (p; [36]), Watterson’s estimator of the population mutation rate (<U+03B8>\n                           W; [37]), and the number of haplotypes (N\n                           h) were calculated using DnaSP v. 5.10.01 [38]. All the statistics were calculated, separately, for the two portions of the five Skåne PgiC1 sequences (5’: exons 5-11; 3’: exons 13-21) and of the 29 Öland (5’: exons 1-12; 3’: exons 13-22) PgiC1 sequences. Total nucleotide diversity (p\n                           T) was estimated separately for each of the 22 studied PgiC1 exons for the 29 Öland PgiC1 sequences. Sliding window analysis of p\n                           T was also carried out for the 29 Öland PgiC1 sequences using DnaSP v. 5.10.01 (window length: 100 bp; step size: 10 bp). The remaining analyses only considered the 29 Öland PgiC1 sequences, unless specified.\n                The level of recombination was estimated (as the minimum number of recombination events, R\n                           M, using the method of Hudson RR and Kaplan NL [39] as implemented in DnaSP v. 5.10.01) for each of the two PgiC1 gene portions in the 29 Öland sequences. The level of recombination was also estimated as the population recombination rate (<U+03C1><U+2009>=<U+2009>4N\n                           er, where Ne is the effective population size and r is the per-generation per-site recombination rate [40]), using the program omegaMap [41]. We used the same procedure as in [34] to run omegaMap, but used a sliding window of 10 codons to estimate <U+03C1> in the present study. The level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within PgiC1 was estimated using r\n                           2 statistics [42], calculated between all pairs of polymorphic sites (excluding a single site that segregates with more than two nucleotides [34]), using Haploview v. 4.2 [43]. The genotypes of the 15 studied Öland individuals [34], at each of the analyzed polymorphic sites, were used as input to the Haploview analyses. In order to generate a complete set of genotype data for the 15 individuals, as required for the Haploview analyses, we included the additional sequence (GenBank accession number KF487766) – acquired from the 15<U+2009>F. ovina individuals but containing an aberrant insertion that may have resulted from incomplete splicing of the PgiC1 precursor mRNA [34]. This insertion was removed for the Haploview analyses.\n                The dN/dS ratio (<U+03C9>) (dN<U+2009>=<U+2009>non-synonymous substitution rate; dS<U+2009>=<U+2009>synonymous substitution rate) was estimated, together with <U+03C1> (using omegaMap), for each amino acid codon translated from the PgiC1 sequence. The estimated <U+03C9> value was used to examine whether purifying (i.e. negative selection, <U+03C9><U+2009><<U+2009>1) or balancing (i.e. positive intraspecific diversifying) selection (<U+03C9><U+2009>><U+2009>1) may have contributed to the amounts and patterning of sequence variation within and between the two gene portions for the 29 studied PgiC1 sequences (cf. [41]). Sliding window analysis of <U+03C9> was also carried out (manually, on the basis of the results from OmegaMap) with a window length of 99 and a step size of 12.\n                Neutrality tests, including the Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé (HKA) test [11], Tajima’s D test [44], Fay and Wu’s H test [45], MacDonald and Kreitman’s (MK) test [46] and Wall’s B and Q tests [47] were also used to examine whether selection may have contributed to the amounts and patterning of sequence variation within each of the two PgiC1 gene portions in the 29 sequences. All the neutrality tests were carried out using DnaSP v. 5.10.01. The significances of the Tajima’s D, Fay and Wu’s H, and Wall’s B and Q were conservatively estimated (without allowing for recombination), using 10 000 coalescent simulations and on the basis of the observed number of segregating sites. A single PgiC cDNA sequence from F. altissima (GenBank accession number DQ225740), encoding cytosolic PGI, was used as the outgroup for the HKA test, Fay and Wu’s H test and the MK test. We used the HKA test to compare the 5’- and 3’-portions of PgiC1 in terms of intraspecific polymorphism (within F. ovina) and interspecific divergence (between F. ovina and F. altissima). In the MK test, we compared the ratio of D\n                           N/D\n                           S (D\n                           N or D\n                           S<U+2009>=<U+2009>the number of fixed non-synonymous [for D\n                           N] or synonymous [for D\n                           S] substitutions per gene between F. ovina and F. altissima), with the ratio of P\n                           N/P\n                           S (P\n                           N or P\n                           S<U+2009>=<U+2009>the number of non-synonymous [for P\n                           N] or synonymous [for P\n                           S] polymorphic sites per gene within F. ovina). The degree of synonymous divergence (K\n                           S [JC]: Jukes-Cantor corrected number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) between the outgroup PgiC sequence and the 29<U+2009>F. ovina PgiC1 sequences was 0.240. Sliding window analyses were also carried out, respectively, for Tajima’s D, <U+03C9>, Fay and Wu’s H, as well as for Ka/Ks (the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site/the number of sysnonymous substitutions per synonymous site), with a window length of 100 bp and a step size of 10 bp using DnaSP v. 5.10.01.\n              Analysis of the evolutionary conservation of amino acid sites\n                The degree of evolutionary conservation at each of the respective PGI amino acid sites corresponding to the PgiC1 translated amino acid sites was estimated, on the basis of the phylogenetic relationships among a large set of homologous sequences, from a wide range of different species, using the online application ConSurf Server [48]. The database UniRef90 [49] was searched for sequences that were homologous with the F. ovina PgiC1 input sequence, using CSI-BLAST [50] (cutoff E-value<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0001; number of interactions<U+2009>=<U+2009>3; maximum homologs to collect<U+2009>=<U+2009>150). Within CSI-BLAST, redundant sequences were filtered out by clustering blast hits with a sequence identity of 95% or more and only using one representative of each cluster in the analysis. BLAST hits that shared a sequence identity of less than 35% with the input sequence were ignored. A multiple-species alignment (Additional file 1: File S1) of the acquired homologous sequences was constructed using MAFFT [51, 52], and this alignment was then used to build a phylogenetic tree using the neighbour-joining algorithm as implemented in the Rate4Site program [53]. The level of evolutionary conservation was then estimated, as a conservation score for each amino acid site using an empirical Bayesian algorithm [54] implemented in the ConSurf Server. The lower the conservation score, the more evolutionarily conserved are the amino acid residues at that specific site. The translated amino acid sequence from a PgiC1 sequence (GenBank accession number KF487738), representing the most common PgiC1 sequence in F. ovina, was used as the input to the ConSurf Server.\n              ResultsSequence variation\n                The analyses of the five Skåne PgiC1 coding sequences confirmed the earlier finding [18] that the 5’ portion of the gene (L [sequence length]<U+2009>=<U+2009>570, S<U+2009>=<U+2009>30, N\n                           h<U+2009>=<U+2009>5, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.025, <U+03B8>\n                           W<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.025) was considerably more polymorphic than the 3’ portion (L<U+2009>=<U+2009>612, S<U+2009>=<U+2009>3, N\n                           h<U+2009>=<U+2009>4, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002, <U+03B8>\n                           W<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.002). Also in agreement with the observed pattern of sequence polymorphism within the five Skåne PgiC1 sequences, the analyses of the 29 Öland PgiC1 cDNA sequences showed that the 5’ portion of the sequence (p\n                           T<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.019, <U+03B8>\n                           W<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.020) was substantially more polymorphic than the 3’ portion of the sequence (p\n                           T<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004, <U+03B8>\n                           W<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007) (Fig. 2, Table 1). There was a significant difference between the p\n                           T values for each of the 12 exons (exons 1–12) within the 5’ portion of the PgiC1 gene in the 29 sequences, and those for each of the 10 exons (exons 13–22) within the 3’ portion of the 29 sequences (Wilcoxon rank sum test; W<U+2009>=<U+2009>96, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.019, Additional file 2: Table S1). The sliding window analyses of p\n                           T showed that the PgiC1 codon site 200 (under positive diversifying selection [34]) was within the highest peak of p\n                           T at exon 8 within the 5’ portion of the gene (Fig. 2).Table 1\n                        Analyses of the 3’ and 5’ portions of 29 PgiC1 sequences from Öland F. ovina\n                                    \n                       \n                              L\n                            \n                              S\n                            \n                              N\n                              h\n                                            p (×10-3)\n                                            <U+03B8>\n                                            W (×10-3)\n                              R\n                              M\n                              <U+03C1>\n                            Mean <U+03C9>\n                                          Tajima’s D\n                                          Fay & Wu’s H\n                                          Wall’s B\n                                          Wall’s Q\n                                          Mean conservation score5’ portion87268211920200.3830.280-0.195 n.s.3.355 n.s.0.015*0.030*0.1053’ portion76120154710.0260.128-1.363 n.s.-1.768 n.s.0.000 n.s.0.000 n.s.-0.121\n                      The table shows the lengths of the 5’ and 3’ portions of the sequence (L), the number of segregating sites (S), the number of haplotypes (N\n                                    h), the total nucleotide diversity (p), the total Watterson’s estimator of population mutation rate (per site) (<U+03B8>\n                                    W), the minimum number of recombination events (R\n                                    M), the population recombination parameter (<U+03C1>) (per site), the average <U+03C9> ratio, Tajima’s D, Fay & Wu’s H, and Wall’s B and Q, as well as the mean conservation score (the smaller the value, the more conserved) estimated using the online ConSurf Server.

The level of recombination in the highly polymorphic 5’ portion (R\n                           M<U+2009>=<U+2009>20; <U+03C1><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.383) was substantially higher than that for the less variable 3’ portion of the gene (R\n                           M<U+2009>=<U+2009>1; <U+03C1><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.026) (Table 1 and Fig. 3_a). However, the matrix of r\n                           2 values (Fig. 3_b) shows that there is a low level of LD throughout the entire PgiC1 gene, with no “strong LD” blocks (cf. [55]).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Levels of recombination and linkage disequilibrium (LD) within the F. ovina PgiC1 sequence. a Population recombination rate (<U+03C1>) across PgiC1.

The level of LD is measured by the pairwise correlation coefficient r\n                                       2 values [42] for all the polymorphic nucleotide sites (except for one that segregates into more than two nucleotides [34]). Shades of grey indicate the r\n                                       2 values, ranging from r\n                                       2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0 (white) to r\n                                       2<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 (black). The proportional spacing of the polymorphic sites, which is scaled according to an earlier published PgiC1 gene sequence (GenBank accession number HQ616103), is indicated by black vertical lines on a white horizontal bar (shown above the LD matrix)\n                      \n              The <U+03C9> and neutrality tests\n                The fact that the overall <U+03C9> (dN/dS ratio) value for the entire PgiC1 sequence was substantially lower than 1 (mean <U+03C9> over all the studied amino acid codons<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.209, Additional file 3: Table S2) indicates that purifying selection has acted on the overall sequence. Purifying selection is also indicated for both the 5’ portion (291 amino acid codons; average <U+03C9><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.280) and the 3’ portion (253 amino acid codons; average <U+03C9><U+2009>=<U+2009>0.128) of the sequence. The fact that codons within the 3’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence had a significantly lower <U+03C9> than those in the 5’ portion (Wilcoxon rank sum test; W<U+2009>=<U+2009>42229, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003) suggests that the 3’ portion may be under stronger purifying selection than the 5’ portion. The sliding window analyses of <U+03C9> showed a marked plateau of <U+03C9> values (between exons 8-9 within the 5’ portion) around the PgiC1 codon site 200 (Fig. 2), that a previous study had suggested was subject to positive diversifying selection [34]. There were 40 segregating sites out of the total of 570 nucleotide sites included in the analysis of the 5’ portion, whereas there were only 14 segregating sites out of 612 sites in the 3’ portion (Additional file 4: Table S3). The levels of interspecific DNA divergence between the two gene portions were similar: 29.6 nucleotide differences among 570 sites for the 5’ portion, and 35.8 nucleotide differences among 612 sites for the 3’ portion (Additional file 4: Table S3). However the HKA test didn’t reject the null neutral model (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.064, Additional file 4: Table S3).\n                Wall’s B and Q values were significant for the 5’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence (Table 1), indicating an excess of LD between adjacent segregating sites, which may reflect balancing selection (cf. [47, 56]). Wall’s B and Q values were non-significant for the 3’portion of the PgiC1 sequence (Table 1). There was a negative, but non-significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.064, Table 1) Tajima’s D for the 3’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence, while the Tajima’s D for the 5’ portion was near zero (D<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.195, Table 1). The sliding window analyses of the Tajima’s D showed that the highest peak of D was located at the PgiC1 codon site 200 (exon 8) (Fig. 2) which was identified as a potential target of positive diversifying selection in an earlier study [34]. The D value at this peak (D<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.439) was near-significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.060; post hoc significance test without correction for multiple tests). The Fay & Wu’s H values were non-significant for both the 5’ (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.669) and the 3’ (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.148) portions of the PgiC1 sequence (Table 1). The sliding window analysis of Fay and Wu’s H showed that the deepest valley of H was at exon 16 (within the 3’ portion), near which a striking valley of Tajima’s D was also observed (Additional file 5: Figure S1). Both D and H had negative values in these valleys (Additional file 5: Figure S1), and according to the post hoc tests of significance (not subject to multiple test correction), the H was significant (H<U+2009>=<U+2009>-1.862, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006), while D was near-significant (D<U+2009>=<U+2009>-1.509, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.095).\n                The MK test rejected the neutral null model for the 3’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence (Fisher’s exact test, P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.018). The significant MK test reflects a lower D\n                           N/D\n                           S ratio (0.064) relative to the P\n                           N/P\n                           S ratio (0.556), which is consistent with purifying selection within this portion of the gene (Table 2).

The 5’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence is substantially more polymorphic than the 3’ portion, and our analyses suggest that the difference in the level of polymorphism may have resulted from different selective regimes in the two portions of the gene.Which evolutionary mechanisms may have contributed to the relatively low level of nucleotide polymorphism within the 3’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence?\n                The parts of a protein that are more important for the stability and/or function of an enzyme are likely to be subject to stronger purifying selection [10] and, therefore, tend to exhibit a lower level of intraspecific polymorphism than the parts of the protein with less stringent functional and structural requirement [11, 12]. In F. ovina, the 3’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence encodes a peptide that includes the structurally important large domain of the PGI monomer [21] and the three most conserved, functionally essential, active site residues [35]. The fact that the peptide translated from the 3’ portion of PgiC1 contains important components of the 3-D structure of PGI suggests that this peptide may have a greater overall importance for the function of PGI than the peptide translated from the 5’ portion of PgiC1. The suggested difference in the functional and structural significance of the translated peptides between the two portions of PgiC1 is supported by the estimated amino acid conservation scores in the present study, which show that the PGI amino acid sites corresponding to the 3’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence tend to be evolutionarily more conserved than those of the 5’ portion in a wide range of species (cf. [48]).\n                If the peptide translated from the 3’ portion of PgiC1 is more important for the function of the PGI enzyme than the peptide from the 5’ portion, then the 3’ portion of the gene may be expected to be under stronger purifying selection than the 5’ portion (cf. [10, 12]). In line with this expectation, the average <U+03C9> value for the 3’ portion of PgiC1 was considerably lower than that for the 5’ portion. The average values for both portions were much lower than 1 (suggesting purifying selection [41]). The fact that the value of Tajima’s D was more strongly negative for the 3’ portion (D<U+2009>=<U+2009>-1.363; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.064) than for the 5’ portion (D<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.195; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.484) of the PgiC1 sequence, is also consistent with the 3’ portion being under stronger purifying selection than the 5’ portion of the sequence (cf. [57]). The significant MK test result for the 3’ portion and the non-significance of the test for the 5’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence may, again, suggest that the 3’ portion is under stronger purifying selection than the 5’ portion of the sequence. The significant MK test for the 3’ portion of PgiC1, with a lower ratio of fixed non-synonymous/synonymous substitutions between species (D\n                           N\n                  /D\n                           S\n                  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.064) than the ratio of non-synonymous/synonymous polymorphism within species (P\n                           N\n                  /P\n                           S\n                  <U+2009>=<U+2009>0.556), suggests purifying selection, where the within-species nonsynonymous polymorphism that is maintained in selection–mutation balance consists mainly of weakly deleterious mutations [58].\n                Because the PGI protein structural elements are closely similar in a wide range of organisms (e.g. [21, 35, 59]), the functional and structural significance and the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism within the Pgi gene might be expected to be similar between F. ovina and other species. However, at present, only a few studies of Pgi have investigated gene-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism. Two of these studies, on the butterflies Melitaea cinxia [60] and Colias eurytheme [61, 62], reveal a nearly uniformly high level of nucleotide polymorphism across the entire Pgi gene. The pattern of nucleotide polymorphism in these two species was interpreted in terms of balancing selection (targeting a few amino acid sites located within the large domain) and moderate to high levels of LD within the entire Pgi gene [60, 61]. A high level of synonymous polymorphism was observed regionally around a nonsynonynous mutation within the 5’ portion of the PgiC gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, and interpreted in terms of balancing selection and an overall low level of recombination [63].\n                In contrast to the Pgi genes of the three species mentioned above, the F. ovina PgiC1 gene showed a high level of recombination (R\n                           M<U+2009>=<U+2009>22): M. cinxia had a R\n                           M of 6 [60], whereas C. eurytheme R\n                           M<U+2009>=<U+2009>11 [61] and A. thaliana showed no clear evidence of recombination [63]). The high estimated recombination value is consistent with the fact that F. ovina is a highly outcrossing species [26], and may indicate that different parts of the sequence could have evolved (at least to some extent) independently, resulting in a non-uniform pattern of nucleotide polymorphism across the sequence. Most of the identified recombination is within the 5’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence, while the 3’ portion of the sequence shows limited recombination. However, the relatively low level of recombination detected for the 3’ portion of the sequence may be a consequence of purifying selection having removed variation at both the sites under selection and linked neutral sites (cf. [64]) – thereby removing the molecular signatures of recombination and lowering the numbers of identified recombination events (cf. [65]). The hypothesis that purifying selection may have removed the detectable signatures of recombination within the 3’ portion of PgiC1 agrees with the PgiC1 LD matrix, where a uniformly low level of LD is observed along the entire PgiC1 cDNA sequence.\n                In addition to purifying selection, a selective sweep may also have contributed to the low level of nucleotide diversity within the 3’ portion of the gene: the near, but non-significant (P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.064), result of the HKA test suggests that variation-reducing selective forces may be acting on the PgiC1 3’ portion and/or variation-increasing forces acting on the 5’ portion (cf. [11]). The sliding window analyses revealed striking valleys of both Fay and Wu’s H and Tajima’s D at exon 16 (within the 3’ portion) (Additional file 5: Figure S1). In these valleys, the Fay and Wu’s H is significantly negative (H<U+2009>=<U+2009>-1.862; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.006) and the Tajima’s D is also near-significantly negative (D<U+2009>=<U+2009>-1.509; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.095). These negative values reflect a high-frequency of derived SNPs (around the valleys), suggesting a selective sweep (cf. [45]). A nearby shallow valley of total nucleotide diversity (Fig. 2) is also suggestive of a selective sweep [9]. The valleys of D and H at exon 16 are close to active site residue His391 (Additional file 5: Figure S1). Sequence patterns that are identified as the signatures of selection in neutrality tests (e.g. Tajima’s D and Fay and Wu’s H) may also result from factors such as population size changes or reflect population structure [66–68]. In the case of the highly outcrossing populations of F. ovina on Öland, population structure is unlikely to be a confounding factor in the neutrality tests. However, because possible confounding effects resulting from changes in population size cannot be excluded, the selective sweep suggested by the H and D tests should be interpreted with caution.\n              Which evolutionary mechanisms may have contributed to the relatively high level of nucleotide polymorphism within the 5’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence?\n                An earlier study [34] identified two F. ovina PgiC1 codon sites (sites 173 and 200) as candidate targets of balancing selection (i.e. positive intraspecific diversifying selection) with a considerably stronger signal of selection for site 200 than for site 173 [34]. The sliding window analyses in the present study support the results of the earlier study and reveal a marked plateau of <U+03C9> around the selected site 200 (but no peak associated with site 173) (Fig. 2). Protein structure modelling suggests that the translated amino acid polymorphism at these two PgiC1 sites may affect either the interaction between the two monomers, or the domain-domain packing of the encoded PGI enzyme and, thus, influence the biochemical properties of the cytosolic PGI enzyme in F. ovina [34]. Biochemical studies in humans have shown that mutations at a few amino acid sites, which have similar 3-D structural locations to the two selected amino acid sites in F. ovina, significantly affect the activity of the PGI enzyme [69, 70].\n                Within F. ovina PgiC1, both codon sites 173 and 200, which were previously identified as candidates for balancing selection [34], are located within the 5’ portion of the sequence (Fig. 2). The significant results from the Wall’s B and Q tests (Table 1) support the suggestion that there has been balancing selection on the 5’ portion of the PgiC1 sequence in F. ovina (cf. [47]). In addition to the significant B and Q tests, signals of balancing selection were also detected at the putative selected site 200. The highest peaks of, respectively, positive Tajima’s D and total nucleotide diversity were observed at or around codon site 200 in the sliding window analyses (Fig. 2), and these peaks are a typical signature of balancing selection (cf. [13, 14]). No marked peak or plateau for polymorphism or for Tajima’s D was observed for the second putative selected site (site 173) in the present study (Fig. 2), in agreement with the previous study [34] which showed a weaker signal of balancing selection for site 173 than for site 200.\n              ConclusionsThe PgiC1 gene in F. ovina represents one of the few reported cases in which the levels of nucleotide polymorphism differ substantially between the 5’ and 3’ portions of a gene. The present study suggests that the contrasting levels of nucleotide polymorphism between the two portions of PgiC1 may have resulted from different selective regimes in the two gene portions. Relatively strong purifying selection appears to have reduced the level of polymorphism within the 3’ portion, whereas balancing selection may have contributed to the maintenance of the polymorphism in the 5’ portion of the sequence. A high overall level of recombination and a low level of LD within PgiC1 may have allowed partially independent selection and evolution within the two portions of the gene.Abbreviations\n                HKA: \n                    Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé test\n                  HPD: \n                    Highest posterior density\n                  LD: \n                    Linkage disequilibrium\n                  MHC: \n                    The major histocompatibility complex\n                  MK test: \n                    MacDonald and Kreitman’s test\n                  PGI: \n                    Phosphoglucose isomerase\n                  SNP: \n                    Single nucleotide polymorphism\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Torbjörn Säll and Anders Tunlid for comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.\n                Funding\n                The study was supported by grant 621-2008-5617 (to H.C.P and Anders Tunlid) from the Swedish Research Council.

Cotton (Gossypium Linnaeus, 1753) is the main natural fiber crop in the world. The resistance gene analog (RGA) cloning after its single chromosome microdissection can greatly promote cotton genome research and breeding.\n              \n                Results\n                Using the linker adaptor PCR (LA-PCR) with the primers of rice disease-resistance homologues, three nucleotide sequences PS016 (KU051681), PS054 (KU051682), and PS157 (KU051680) were obtained from the chromosome Ah01 of upland cotton (cv. TM-1). The Blast results showed that the three sequences are the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type RGAs. Clustering results indicated that they are homologous to these published RGAs. Thus, the three RGAs can definitely be confirmed as NBS-LRR class of RGAs in upland cotton.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Using single chromosome microdissection technique, DNA libraries containing cotton RGAs were obtained. This technique can promote cotton gene cloning, marker development and even the improvement of cotton genome research and breeding.\n              KeywordsUpland cottonChromosome microdissectionMicrocloningRGABackgroundChromosome microdissection is one of the most important techniques in molecular cytogenetic research. Specific chromosome or chromosomal sections are isolated using a glass needle or laser under a microscope, and then are enzymatically digested and amplified to construct DNA library of a single chromosome or chromosomal section. Research focusing on a single chromosome or a chromosomal subsection can greatly reduces subsequent work, such as identifying, screening and minimizing the whole genome screening. This technique has been widely used in Drosophila, humans and many other animals since its establishment [1–8] Subsequently, the technique has been widely adapted to apply in herbaceous plants including barley, wheat, rice, and tomato [9–18] and woody plants such as pomelo and poplar [19, 20].Plants have developed defensive mechanisms to protect themselves from pathogen infection through a number of evolutionary processes. The gene-for-gene hypothesis proposed by Flor is based on the interactions between pathogenic fungi and host plants and constitutes the theoretical basis of cloning avirulence genes from pathogens and resistance genes (R genes) from plants [21]. So far, many R genes have been cloned from different host plants using positional cloning and transposon tagging methods. However, considering the large number of physiological races of pathogens, transposon tagging and positional cloning methods are clearly inefficient. Thus new strategies and methods should be adopted to accelerate the cloning of disease R genes. Due to the conserved domains of R genes, homologous sequence amplification or the homologous sequence-based candidate gene approach would be a good choice; actually, these techniques have been quickly adopted by the scientific community. A great progress has been made in recent years for obtaining disease RGAs from many plant species [22–28]. Additionally, some of these RGAs were used as probes for linkage analysis and positioning [22–24, 27].As the primary natural fiber crop, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plays an important role in the world’s economy. However, cotton cells contain large amounts of secondary metabolites, and their chromosomes are small in size and nearly identical to each other. These prevent in somehow to well prepare the chromosomes from the cells and clearly distinguish them from their karyotypes, and thus cytogenetic research of cotton is still lagging behind other plant species, such as rice and wheat. As a typical tetraploid plant species [29–35], there are two sub-genome (A1A1D1D1, 2n = 4× = 52) and high number of nucleotide sequence repeats in cotton genome. There are greater uncertainties in interpreting whole genome while assembling or annotating [33, 34]. Microdissection of a single chromosome or its subsections using direct micromanipulation techniques and gene microcloning through molecular biology should be one easy way to slove this problem. However, currently, there is only one report about single chromosome microdissection that was from somatic cells [36], there is no any report on chromosome microdissection from pollen mother cells (PMC) and on gene microcloning from single chromosome.There are many important genes are closely related to disease resistance, fiber development, fiber quality and yield in the Ah01 chromosome of TM-1 upland cotton [37–39]. In this study, the Ah01chromosome was microdissected from the Ah01 monosome materials derived from TM-1 (a genetically standard line of upland cotton) using the laser method. A DNA pool was constructed from the single chromosome by amplifying DNA using linker adaptor polymerase chain reaction (LA-PCR). RGAs from this chromosome were then cloned.MethodsPlant materials\n                A accession of Ah01 monosome, developed from the genetically standard line of upland cotton at Texas A&M University (U.S.) [40], was used as the primary plant materials. The accession was grown in the Greenhouses at the Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, (ICR-CAAS) (Anyang, Henan, China) and is also maintained in the National Wild Cotton Nursery located at Sanya City, Hainan Island, China.\n              SSR markers and primers\n                The chromosome-Ah01-specific BAC clone 52D06 was provided by Professor Tianzhen Zhang of Nanjing Agricultural University. The primers of corresponding simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker BNL3580 (F primer: CTTGTTTACATTCCCTTCTTTATACC; R primer: CAAAGGCGAACTCTTCCAAA), degenerate specific primers P1 (5'-GATCCTGAGCTCGAATTCGACCC-3') and P2 (5'-GGGTCGAATTCGAGCTCAG-3') were synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biotech Inc. [41].\n              Preparation of mitotic metaphase chromosomes\n                Mitotic metaphase chromosomes were prepared according to a previous report [36] with a few modifications. The slides prepared were kept at -20 °C for a long-term storage or at 4 °C for a short period storage. Slides were baked at 60 °C overnight immediately before use.\n              Preparation of film-slides\n                Sampling, fixing, and enzymatic hydrolysis of flower buds were performed according to the protocol of Peng et al. [36]. Enzymatically digested anthers were smeared on film-slides as previously described [36].\n              Microdissection of single chromosome and LA-PCR amplification\n                Single chromosome was microdissected using the CellCutPlus Laser micromanipulation system (MMI Company, Swiss) and LA-PCR amplification was conducted as previously described [36]. Positive (~10 pg of genomic DNA added to the initial template) and negative controls (no genomic DNA added to the initial template) were also set up.\n              Agarose electrophoresis\n                Two rounds of LA-PCR products were separated through electrophoresis with 1% agarose at 100 V for 30 min. LA-PCR products were observed and photographed under UV light after 40 min staining with ethidium bromide.\n              Southern hybridization\n                Southern hybridization was conducted with PCR products, partially digested genomic DNA, positive control (PCR product from genomic DNA as template) and negative control (no template PCR reaction) [42].\n              SSR amplification\n                The amplified pool of Ah01 chromosomes and second LA-PCR products were amplified using the chromosome- Ah01- specific SSR primer respectively. The amplified products were checked by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).\n              Fluorescence in situ hybridization\n                Dual-color FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and the detection of metaphase chromosome specimens were performed according to a previous [36]. The second round of LA-PCR products labeled with DIG (Digoxigenin-11-dUTP, Roche) and specific Biotin (Biotin-16-dUTP) labeled bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (52D06) were used as probes, which were detected by Anti-Digoxigenin-Rhodamine (red) and FITC-Anti-Biotin (green) (Roche Diagnostics, USA), respectively. Cot-1 DNA was used to pre-hybridize for blocking the repetitive sequences. Chromosomes were counterstained by 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in VECTASHIELD anti-fade solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The hybridization signals were observed using a fluorescence microscope with a change-coupled device (CCD) camera (Zeiss Axiokop2 plus). The images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop CS3 software.\n              Cloning and analysis of RGAs\n                RGA sequences were obtained by PCR with the Ah01 chromosome second round LA-PCR product as template and P1 and P2 as degenerate specific primers. Positive control (about 10 pg of genomic DNA was added to the initial substrate) and negative control (no template) reactions were also performed. The PCR products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization. The target bands of the PCR products were recovered. Positive clones were obtained, and sequenced, and the sequences were used as a probe BLAST search of homologues in NCBI Genbank database.. Screened homologous RGA clones were sequenced by Shanghai Sangon Biotech Inc. Introns were annotated with ORFinder. The sequences were queried against the tetraploid Gossypium hirsutum genome sequcence [33, 34]. The final obtained sequences were submitted to Genbank. BlastN search was performed in GeneBank using these sequences, and a sequence cluster was created by Phylip.\n              ResultsChromosomes preparation and microdissection\n                PMCs moderately digested in an enzymatic mixture were stained with carbolfuchsin. The PMCs at metaphase I were used for chromosome preparation (Fig. 1a). The target chromosome Ah01was initially found under low magnification, and then captured under high magnification for collection in a tube containing10 µL proteinase K (50 ng·µL-1) solution. The protocols for cutting and collecting chromosomes are shown in the Figure 1. For comparison, other chromosomes in metaphase I were simultaneously collected in different tubes for SSR-amplified proof after second LA-PCR amplification.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Microdissection and collection of single mono-chromosomes by CellCut Plus laser manipulation. a Film-slide preparations of meiotic metaphase I chromosomes with one monomer chromosome (Ah01). b Film-slide preparations of meiotic metaphase I chromosomes with one microdissected chromosome. c The microdissected chromosome on the cap of a collection tube.

Bar: 5 µm\n                      \n              LA-PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA\n                Two rounds of LA-PCR were conducted to amplify the Ah01 chromosomal DNA. Electrophoresis results (Fig. 2) revealed that a weak DNA smear with sizes ranging from 200 to 1000 bp after the initial LA-PCR (Fig. 2, lane 3), and a strong DNA smearing pattern with sizes ranging from 300 to 2500 bp were generated after the second LA-PCR (Fig. 2, lane 5, 6), because of more products. For the negative controls, there were no bands (Fig. 2, lane 1, 2). The positive control produced a weak initial band (Figure 2, lane 4) and an obvious smearing pattern after the second LA-PCR (lane 7 in Figure 2). These results indicated that the Ah01 chromosome was amplified successfully.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Agarose gel electrophoresis of LA-PCR products. 1, 2: Negative controls 3 Product from the first round LA-PCR. 4, 7: Positive controls. 5, 6: Products from the second round LA-PCR.

Results of Southern blot showed that the second products of LA-PCR (Fig. 3, lane 4–6) and positive control (Fig. 3, lane 2, 3) had obvious bands, indicating that the amplification products from G. hirsutum genome were ranging from 300 to 2000 bp; that was consistent with the results from agarose gel electrophoresis. There were no bands in the negative control PCR (Figure 3, lane 1).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Southern blotting of products from the second round LA-PCR. 1: The negative control. 2, 3: Positive controls. 4, 5, 6: The second round LA-PCR products. 7: \n                                       EcoRI digested genomic DNA.

Results were checked by PAGE, and it was observed that the Ah01chromosome could amplify a specific band (240 bp), as shown in Fig. 4 (Fig. 4, lane 10). The similar band was obtained using the genome DNA as positive control (Lane 12), no band in negative control (Fig. 4, lane 11) and partly others chromosomes (Fig. 4, lane 1–9).\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        PAGE of SSR primer amplification product from single chromosome pool. 1–9: SSR primer amplification products from partial other chromosomes pool with Ah01 chromosome specific primer. 10: SSR primer amplification products from single chromosome pool with chromosome Ah01 special primer (arrow indicated). 11: The negative control. 12: The positive control.

As shown in Fig. 5, the target chromosomes were accurately identified by means of the specific BAC clone as well as products of LA-PCR II. Meanwhile, partial other chromosomes had weak signal (red light), indicating homologous sequence on these chromosomes.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        FISH signals of products from the second round LA-PCR. a Chromosomes stained with DAPI. b Signals fromproducts of LA-PCR II (red). c Signals fromchromosome Ah01 specific BAC (green, arrow indicated). d Signals from dual-FISH\n                      \n              Isolation of RGAs\n                RGAs were isolated using PCR with P1 and P2 as primers, and TM-1 upland cotton genomic DNA and the second round LA-PCR Ah01 chromosome pool as templates, respectively. Products were detected by gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization. Using genomic DNA as positive control, a slightly wider DNA smear with sizes ranging from 400 to 1000 bp and a major band of 550 ~ 700 bp was generated (Fig. 6a, Lane3). A narrow DNA smear with sizes ranging from 550 to 800 bp and a main band of 650 bp was generated using the second LA-PCR products as template (Fig. 6a, Lane 2). Southern blot results demonstrated that the products come from the genome of upland cotton (Fig. 6b).\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        Agarose gel electrophoresis (a) and Southern blotting (b) of P1/P2 primer PCR products.

Two hundred positive clones (PS001 ~ PS200) were obtained and sequenced, followed by BLAST analysis. Three sequences [(Additional file 1) named PS016 (Genbank ID: KU051681), PS054 (Genbank ID: KU051682) and PS157 (Genbank ID: KU051680)] contained a conserved domain common to the NBS-LRR R genes in plant. Clustering results showed that they were homologous to these published RGAs (Fig. 7). Alignment was made with others RGAs from NCBI (Additional file 2), the results also definitely confirmed that the three RGAs were the NBS-LRR class of RGAs in cotton.\n                      \n                    Fig. 7\n                        Cluster analysis of single chromosome RGA nucleotide sequenceswith those from other species\n                      \n              DiscussionIdentification and microdissection of a single chromosome\n                Accurate identification of the target chromosome is a key step in chromosome microdissection and cloning. Identification of the target chromosome has mainly relied on the morphological features such as monosome, trisome, nullisome and shape-specific chromosomes [9–11, 43–47]. Chromosome banding technique has also been reported as a method to identify chromosomes [48], but this method has not widely used in plants. In this study, monosome chromosome in meiotic metaphase I were easy to identify and isolate from other chromosomes.\n                There are three approaches reported for chromosome isolation. One is flow cytometry, which has facilitated the dissection of large genome into smaller and defined segments for the purpose of gene discovery and genome sequencing in plants [13]. Nevertheless, this method not only requires expensive instrumentation, but also fails to distinguish chromosomes with similar morphological characteristics from one to another, which limit its application in plants to some extent. The second approach is the glass needle method, which involves in dissection of the target chromosome under an optical microscope by a glass needle. The approach is easily operate and independent from high-end instrumentation, which has resulted in effective and widespread application in plants [16, 20]. However, the approach requires the operator to be trained well enough, or there should be much deviation operated by different persons or even in different personal statuses by an operator. The third method is laser cutting [44, 49], in which chromosome specimens are dispersed onto a special carrier covered with a membrane for dissection and collection. In most cases, dissection is much easier than collection. In this study, the CellCutPlus Laser microdissection system was applied to isolate the target chromosome. Initially, cotton chromosomes were spread on the microscope slide coated with film, and then a single chromosome was dissected and automatically collected in a microcentrifuge tube with a sticky cap. This method has a high efficiency and a low risk of contamination.\n              Confirmation of the chromosomal DNA\n                LA-PCR is a powerful tool for the amplification of long DNA segments, and it has been widely used in molecular biology [18, 50, 51]. In this research, Ah01 chromosomal DNA was acquired by LA-PCR after microdissection of the target chromosome. Prior to subsequent steps, the PCR products were examined by agarose electrophoresis, Southern blot analysis, SSR primer confirmation and confirmed by FISH. Combining several confirmation methods could achieve multiple analyses, and ensure that amplification products were from the target chromosome.\n              Significance of generating RGAs from specific single chromosome of cotton\n                R genes have been isolated from the whole genome or its cDNA in woody plants [7, 19, 20, 39]. In this study, RGAs were isolated from a single chromosome dissected from upland cotton, clarifying the source and location. Efficiency of downstream work was greatly improved due to the isolation of a single chromosome from the entire genome. It has been reported that the R genes family frequently clusters on a certain chromosomal segment [52]. Acquired RGAs could be transformed to molecular marks, and serve to construct a genetic map due to the clear linkage relationship from one chromosome. In addition, it will contribute to the development of map-based cloning, thus, generating RGAs from a specific chromosome has many advantages.\n              ConclusionsAlthough cotton is one major crop in the world like rice, wheat and maize, its cytogenetic studies falls much behind others due to the smaller and identical chromosomes in morphology as well as large amounts of secondary metabolites within its cells. All these factors make the cotton chromosome preparation difficult. Here, we successfully developed a technique to separate a single chromosome from upland cotton PMC (monosome cells) with the laser cutting. Using this technology, we also microcloned three RGAs from the DNA pool constructed with the single chromosomes (Ah01). The three RGAs belong to the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) gene family. The techniques will promote the cloning of cotton R genes and marker assistant improvement of cotton genetics and breeding.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe deeply thank Prof. Tianzhen Zhang (Nanjing Agricultural University, China) for kindly providing the chromosome-specific BAC clone.\n                Funding\n                The research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31471548), State Key Laboratory of Cotton Biology Open Fund (No. CB2014A07), the Program for Science & Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province (13HASTIT026).\n              \n                Authors’ contributions\n                RP and KW designed the study; XC, YL, ZL, FL, YW, ZZ, XC, XW, CW, YW and ZL performed the experiments; YL wrote the manuscript, RP and KW proofread the manuscript.

To comprehensively investigate the alkaline acclimation mechanisms in P. triloba, a series of analyses were conducted under alkaline stress, including analyses of the kinetics of molecular and physiological changes, and leaf microstructure.\n              \n                Results\n                To understand the kinetics of molecular changes under short-term alkaline stress, we used Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to identify alkaline stress-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in P. triloba. Approximately 53.0 million high-quality clean reads were generated from 59.6 million raw reads, and a total of 124,786 unigenes were obtained after de novo assembly of P. triloba transcriptome data. After alkaline stress treatment, a total of 8948 unigenes were identified as DEGs. Based on these DEGs, a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted, suggesting that 28 genes may play an important role in the early alkaline stress response. In addition, analysis of DEGs with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) revealed that pathways were significant at different treatment time points. A significant positive correlation was found between the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results and the RNA-Seq data for seven alkaline-related genes, confirming the reliability of the RNA-Seq results. Based on physiological analysis of P. triloba in response to long-term alkaline stress, we found that the internal microstructures of the leaves of P. triloba changed to adapt to long-term alkaline stress. Various physiological indexes indicated that the degree of membrane injury increased with increasing duration of alkaline stress, affecting photosynthesis in P. triloba seedlings.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                This represents the first investigation into the physiology and transcriptome of P. triloba in response to alkaline stress. The results of this study can enrich the genomic resources available for P. triloba, as well as deepening our understanding of molecular and physiological alkaline tolerance mechanisms in P. triloba. This will also provide new insights into our understanding of alkaline acclimation mechanisms in Chinese plum (Prunus salicina) trees.\n              KeywordsAlkaline stressDifferentially expressed genes\n                        Prunus triloba LindlPhysiological analysisRNA sequencingBackgroundChinese plum (Prunus salicina Lindl.) is a small deciduous tree that belongs to the genus Prunus in the Rosaceae family. The wild peach (Prunus persica Lindl.) is widely used as its rootstock in the area south of the Yangtze River in the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan; in the arid area of the northwest district; and in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and other areas in China. While the wild peach possesses the characteristics of high adaptability, developed roots, fast growth, good grafting affinity, and rapid germination speed [1], it also possesses some less positive characteristics. The major drawback of the wild peach is its poor saline-alkaline resistance. When the soil pH reaches 7.5–9.0, iron chlorosis generally occurs in plant tissues. This not only causes plants to oxidize available Fe2+, leading to the precipitation Fe(OH)3, but also influences other iron dissolution pathways and reduces the stability of chelated iron, leading to iron malabsorption [2, 3].The central hill area in the Sichuan Basin is the main planting region for plum trees in China, and it widely consists of calcareous purple soils. The pH values of these soils range from 7.69 to 8.47, and iron chlorosis is common among fruit trees in this area. Iron chlorosis occurs easily in regions with alkaline soil; when fruit trees are under alkaline stress for an extended period of time, they grow poorly, fail to grow flowers or fruits, and may even die, having a detrimental effect on the fruit tree industry [2]. Recently, several methods have been explored for improving saline-alkaline soils [4, 5]. Among these, the selection of an appropriate saline-alkaline-tolerant plant suited to the type of saline-alkaline soil is the main method used to cultivate plants on saline-alkaline land [5]. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of alkaline damage of various plants and to select alkaline-resistant varieties of fruit trees or improve the alkaline resistance of fruit trees. However, the alkaline tolerance of fruit trees is actually dependent on the rootstock alkaline tolerance. Because the rootstock variety directly affects the fruiting time, yield, and lifetime of fruit trees, so the screening of alkaline-tolerant rootstocks is an effective way to improve the alkaline resistance of fruit trees.\n                        Prunus triloba Lindl., also known as flowering plum or flowering almond, is a deciduous and flowering shrub or small tree species of the genus Prunus (family Rosaceae) native to northeastern, northwestern, and northern China [6, 7]. P. triloba is a popular ornamental plant in China, especially known as an important early spring flowering ornamental in the landscape of northern China. There are many varieties of P. triloba, and it has been cultivated for more than 300 years [6, 8]. It is an octaploid with a karyotype of 2n = 8x = 64, and it possesses the characteristics of good adaptability, tolerance to poorly drained soils and to low level management, tolerance to cold stress and to drought stress, and high disease resistance [6, 9, 10]. In addition, P. triloba is a naturally salt-alkaline-tolerant plant, and it grows well in saline-alkaline soils with a pH of 8.8 (0.3% salt content). P. triloba has good grafting affinity with Chinese plum, bears fruit early, results in high yield, suggesting that it can be used as the rootstock of P. salicina in the middle hill region in the Sichuan Basin [9].A range of abiotic and biotic stresses can severely restrict plant growth and reduce crop productivity, of which soil salinity, alkalinity, or saline-alkalinity are the most common abiotic stresses encountered by plants [11]. These types of soils are widely distributed across more than 100 countries [12]. The salinization of soil is usually caused by neutral salt (NaCl, Na2SO4, etc.), while the alkalinization of soil is usually caused by alkaline salt (NaHCO3, Na2CO3, etc.) and soil saline-alkalinity is caused by the presence of both neutral and alkaline salts [13]. In contrast to saline soil, which mainly affects plants through osmotic stress and ion toxicity, alkaline soil damages plants through high pH [14]. Previous research showed that the negative effect of soil alkalinization on plants was greater than that of soil salinization [11, 13]. While there have been a number of reports on the mechanisms of plant tolerance to salinity [15], much less attention has been paid to the plant response to alkaline stress. Therefore, analysis of the underlying mechanisms of soil alkalinity on plant growth and development are urgently needed, especially for commercial crops.Plant stress resistance is not the result of a single mechanism of action but rather is a complex stress response borne of various aspects of cell, physiological, and molecular biology. The physiological and biochemical mechanisms of plant abiotic stress tolerance have widely been studied by researchers, and the underlying molecular mechanisms have always been the focus of plant biology research area. The molecular mechanisms of plant abiotic stress tolerance involve multiple genes and complex genetic regulatory networks [16]. Only by understanding the functions of these stress-inducible genes can we decipher the related physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance [16]. Of late, emerging high-throughput techniques have become a significant means of achieving this goal. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology is frequently used to study plant stress tolerance because it is an economical, sensitive, and efficient tool for the identification and analysis of key stress-responsive genes. In addition, it can be used for non-model species [17–19].Therefore, in order to comprehensively investigate alkaline acclimation mechanisms in P. triloba, a series of analyses were performed under alkaline stress, including assessment of the kinetics of molecular and physiological changes, and leaf microstructure. The Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform was used to examine the transcriptomes of leaf samples from alkaline-treated or control P. triloba seedlings. We then de novo assembled a transcriptome library of P. triloba to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from plants under alkaline stress. To our knowledge, this is the first physiological and transcriptomic analysis of P. triloba in response to alkaline stress. Our results will enrich genomic resources for P. triloba and deepen our understanding of molecular and physiological alkaline tolerance mechanisms in P. triloba. Our results also will provide new insight into understanding alkaline acclimation mechanisms in Chinese plum (P. salicina) trees.MethodsPlant materials and alkaline stress treatment conditions\n                The seeds of P. triloba were preserved in low temperature sand in November 2014. On the middle ten days of the second month of the second year, the seeds of P. triloba were sown in the earthenware pots, about 25 cm in diameter, and with holes in the bottom. Each pot was filled with equal amount of soils, which were fully mixed by peat soil and turfy soil in the ratio of 1 to 1. When the height of seedlings reached to about 15 cm, 120 plantlets with similar size and growth, housing outdoor with a transparent plastic film at the top to keep out the rain, were selected to subject to alkaline stress treatments as the test materials, and other 30 plantlets were selected as control group. The plantlets of alkaline stress treatments were watered using alkaline liquor, which was established by mixing NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 at 9:1 molar ratio, and the concentration and pH value of the solution were 50 mmol/L and 9.11 ± 0.104, respectively. The alkaline solution was firstly used to water the test materials at 16:00 sunny day. Thereafter, the alkaline solution was poured every 3 days, and every time until the pH of effluent from the bottom of pot reached more than 9.0. The control group was simultaneously with the same amount of water irrigation. The alkaline treatment lasted for 12 days.\n              \n                           De novo transcriptome analysis of P. triloba in response to short-term alkaline stress\n                RNA isolation, cDNA library construction and sequencing\n                  We separately sampled the leaf blades at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h after the alkaline stress. The harvested leaf samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. This process was performed in two biological replicates at the each time point, of which each replicate consisted of 10 pooled leaves. The achieved ten P. triloba samples were isolated using the Universal Plant RNA Extraction Kit (Aidlab, Beijing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA purity, concentration, and quality were examined with a Nanodrop 2000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA), Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, USA) and Agilent 2100 Eukaryote Total RNA Nano Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), respectively.\n                  Total 10 RNA samples of P. triloba were then delivered to GENEWIZ, Inc. (Suzhou, China) for cDNA library construction and sequencing. In briefly, cDNA library was built for each of 10 RNA samples using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). In order to ensure the quality of the library, a Beckman AMPure XP Bead Kit (Beckman Coulter, Danvers, MA, USA) and Agilent 2100 High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent) were then used to purify and to detect the quality of the library, respectively, and the effective concentration of the library was accurately quantified with a ABI 7500 real time PCR system. Subsequently, cBOT automatic clustering of these qualified cDNA libraries were conducted using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit V3 (Illumina). Finally, High-throughput sequencing was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform by synthesis.\n                De novo transcriptome assembly\n                  The obtained sequencing raw data in FASTq format were initially processed by Trimmomatic (v0.30) [20] to get high-quality clean data, which trimmed reads containing adaptors, filtered off low quality reads (bases with quality scores<20 at the 3' or 5' end) and reads with poly-N, and removed sequences shorter than 20 bp. The clean reads from each library were evaluated with the Q20 (the percentage of bases with a Phred value >20), Q30 (the percentage of bases with a Phred value >30), GC-content, and N-content, and were checked using fastqc (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Then, de novo assembly of the clean reads was achieved using the Trinity assembler (version r2013-02-25) [21]. The software TGICL [22] was further used to splice sequences and redundancy analysis in order to produce longer, more complete non-redundant sequences which were called unigenes. The software TransDecoder [23] was introduced to predict the open reading frames (ORFs) of transcripts and to extract longest open-ended ORFs. Finally, the clean reads were mapped to the unigenes using Bowtie2 (v2.1.0) [24] with the default parameters.\n                Quantification of gene expression levels and differential expression analysis\n                  The gene expression level of the assembled unigenes of each sample was separately estimated by software RSEM (V 1.2.4) [25] using the FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million reads) method. Differential gene expression analysis of all samples after different periods of alkaline stress was performed using the R package DESeq (V 1.14.0) based on the negative binomial distribution [26] to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in P. triloba treated with alkaline stress. The P-value corresponded to the differential gene expression test. A False discovery rate (FDR) method was used to determine the threshold of the P-value. Genes with a FDR threshold = 0.05 and |log2 (fold change)| > 1 found by DESeq were designated as differentially expressed. Afterwards, GO functional categories were assigned to differentially expressed genes implementing by the R package GOseq based on the Walleius non-central hyper-geometric distribution [27]. DEGs also underwent KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in order to systematically understand the biological pathways involved in the DEGs using software KOBAS [28].\n                Gene validation of qRT-PCR analysis\n                  To validate the DEGs detected by RNA-Seq, seven unigenes, which were determined to be significantly related to alkaline stress, were subjected to real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The RNA samples were extracted from the leaf tissues of P. triloba materials at 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h after the alkaline stress using the same method described above. A TUREscript 1st Stand cDNA SYNTHESIS Kit (Aidlab Biotechnologies Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) was used to synthesize the cDNAs as described by the manufacturer using an Oligo (dT) Primer with 500 ng total RNA. Specific primers designed for the seven selected genes were listed (Table 1). Real-time RT-PCR of the seven genes in technical and biological triplicates was performed using 2×SYBR® Green Supermix (DBI® Bioscience, Germany) in an optical 96-well plate with a qTOWER2.2 Real-Time PCR System (Anlytik Jena AG, Germany) in final reaction volumes of 25 µL, each containing 5 µL 1× 2×SYBR® Green Supermix (DBI® Bioscience, Germany), 0.5 µL 200 nM of the reverse primer and sense primer, 1 µL cDNA template, and 3 µL ddH2O. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C 3 min; 39 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and then increasing the temperature to 95 °C (+1 °C/cycle, holding time 4 s). The internal reference gene was the actin gene. The relative expression level of each gene was determined using threshold cycles, by the 2-<U+25B3><U+25B3>Ct method.Table 1\n                          Primer information for qRT-PCR\n                        Gene OntologyIDUpstream / downstream primer (5'-3')AP-2 complex subunit alphac78498_g1_i1CACTGGTATAGGCTGAAGAATTCGGTAACAATATGGTCAATGALDH18A1, P5CSc80260_g1_i1TGGTATCTTAGTGGACTCAACTTATTGGACTTGTGAAmitogen-activated protein kinase 1/3c81662_g1_i1GTGTTGCTGTTGGTGTTGCTTCTTCCTCCTCCTCTCAaroDE, DHQ-SDHc84090_g1_i1GTAGTGTCAGTAGGTATGGAGAGGAGGTTAGGTGCGTGGATAP2-like factor, ANT lineagec85502_g2_i1GCAGCATCATAAGGAATCGGCAGCAACAATATCAATtrehalose 6-phosphate synthase/phosphatasec85846_g1_i3GCCAGCATATTGTTGAAGCCATCATTGACCATTCTTGmitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1c88652_g1_i2CATCTATCTGTGGAAGGAGCATCTGAATAGGAATCTGACTINGCCGAGTATGATGAATCTGGAGTCTGCCTATCCTTGA\n                Physiological analysis of P. triloba in response to long-term alkaline stress\n                Effects of long-term alkaline stress on the leaf microstructure of P. triloba\n                           \n                  The upper leaf blades of the test materials on 0 d and 12 d after the alkaline stress were sampled to immediately use for observing the blade structure through the microscope. The center area (5 mm × 5 mm) of both sides of leaves avoided the leaf vein were sampled by one side blade. The harvested slices were placed in distilled water in petri dish, and then their upper and lower epidermis were removed with a tweezer. The obtained transparent slices without upper and lower epidermis were selected to place in a slide center, and some distilled water were added to these slices, and then were covered with a coverslip. After above steps, the morphology structure of the transparent slice was examined by microscope. The thickness of the cuticle, the palisade tissue, the spongy tissue, the epidermal cells, and the stomata were as the observation indexes. Each index was observated 10 visual fields in the corresponding parts of slice, and its average number was counted, meanwhile, was photographed.\n                Effects of long-term alkaline stress on P. triloba seedling physiological indices\n                  We separately sampled the leaf blades of P. triloba at 16:00 pm on day 0, 3 d, 6 d, 9 d and 12 d after the alkaline stress. The harvested leaf samples were used for the determination of the physiological activity indexes, and each index was sampled at random for three replicates. Ten physiological activity indexes were measured, including relative water content (RWC), relative electrical conductivity (REC), chlorophyll (Chl) content, soluble sugar content (SSC), soluble protein content (SPC), proline (Pro) content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, the activity of peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The RWC, the content of MDA, the activity of POD, and SOD were determined according to Sun and Hu [29]; the calculation of the REC was made according to Xue and Xia [30]; the chlorophyll (Chl) content was determined according to Zhu et al [31]; the SSC, SPC, Pro content, and the activity of CAT were measured according to Li [32].\n                Effects of long-term alkaline stress on P. triloba seedling photosynthetic parameters\n                  The healthy and representative leaf blades of the test materials under alkaline stress and control materials on the 12th day were also used for the determination of diurnal dynamics of the photosynthetic characteristics. The photosynthetic parameters, including the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), the internal CO2 concentration (Ci), and transpiration rate (Tr), were measured every 2 h using a Li-6400XT portable photosynthesis system from 7:00 am to 19:00 pm. The water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated by the following formula: WUE = Pn/Tr. Each parameter was measured for nine replicates under a 3 (leaf) × 3 (plantlet) arrangement.\n                Results and discussion\n                           De novo transcriptome analysis of P. triloba in response to short-term alkaline stress\n                Sequence analysis and assembly\n                  In this study, we used the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to obtain a total of 595,894,216 raw P. triloba reads during different stages of alkaline stress. These raw data were deposited in the NCBI SRA database under accession number SRP098782. After quality control trimming and filtering, there were 529,847,752 high-quality reads (~62.10 Gb clean data) remaining. The Q20, Q30, and GC content of the clean data were over 99.16, 97.69, and 45.16%, respectively, for each sample (Table 2). These results showed that our obtained clean reads were of a sufficiently high quality for subsequent analysis. Using the de novo assembly software Trinity and TGICL, 124,786 unigenes were obtained for all samples, with an average size of 668.65 bp and an N50 length of 1111 bp (Fig. 1). Among the assembled unigenes, 80,060 (64.16%) were 200–500 bp in length while 22,426 (17.97%) were 500–1000 bp in length (Fig. 1). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale P. triloba genomic resource to be made available. The obtained transcript sequences therefore enrich the genomic resources available for P. triloba and can be used not only for gene discovery but also for identification of simple sequence repeat (SSR) or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.Table 2\n                          Summary of sequences analysis\n                        SampleRaw readsClean readsClean basesQ20 (%)Q30 (%)GC (%)A1-033,244,26230,036,6443.51 G99.4398.4346.00A2-067,111,31259,313,0646.97 G99.2597.9446.38A1-175,018,60266,678,6447.80 G99.2898.0345.41A2-150,426,16845,822,0605.38 G99.4498.4345.49A1-342,772,04638,114,6544.45 G99.2797.9946.08A2-365,192,03457,586,4086.76 G99.2597.9345.66A1-646,008,22441,153,3984.81 G99.2797.9845.46A2-668,608,07660,487,3487.09 G99.2597.9545.43A1-1275,873,65267,335,6347.90 G99.1697.6945.21A2-1271,639,84063,319,8987.43 G99.2497.9145.16Total595,894,216529,847,75262.10 G–––\n                        \n                      Fig. 1\n                          Pie chart for length distribution of the assembled unigenes\n                        \n                Quantitative analysis of gene expression and identification of differentially expressed genes\n                  In this study, the FPKM method was used to estimate the gene expression levels of assembled unigenes from each sample. Within the 10 samples, 20.27–32.49% of unigenes exhibited FPKM values between 0 and 1, while only 1.24–1.57% exhibited FPKM values over 60 (Additional file 1). Gene expression levels in these samples were compared by assessing the distribution diagram of the FPKMs of all genes. As shown in the Additional file 2, the density of genes among these 10 samples was highest at the log FPKM values about range within -0.30 to -0.60, and the maximum gene density was highest for sample A1-12.\n                  Genes with an FDR threshold = 0.05 and |log2 (fold change)| > 1 according to DESeq were designated as differentially expressed. In this study, among 124,786 unigenes, 8948 (7.17%) were identified as DEGs in leaves under alkaline stress. Among these, 0, 186, 3211 and 8347 DEGs were discovered through transcriptome comparison of the samples 1 h vs. 0 h, 3 h vs. 0 h, 6 h vs. 0 h, and 12 h vs. 0 h, respectively (Fig. 2). The number of DEGs found in the 12 h vs. 0 h comparison (8347) was therefore the highest. This result is inconsistent with the patterns found in Puccinellia tenuiflor [19] and wild soybean (Glycine soja) [33] roots, where the number of DEGs at 6 h was higher than that at 12 and 24 h. This difference might be attributed to the fact that the cellular response to extracellular signals in the leaves occurs later than that in the roots. It is noteworthy that no DEGs were detected until after 3 h of stress treatment in this study. This result was similar to that in wild soybean (G. soja) [33] roots, which also took 3 h to respond to alkaline stress at the transcription level. Of the 8948 DEGs, 181 were up-regulated in 3 h vs. 0 h; 1999 were up-regulated in 6 h vs. 0 h; and 4895 were up-regulated in 12 h vs. 0 h. In contrast, 5, 1212, and 3452 DEGs were down-regulated in 3 h vs. 0 h, 6 h vs. 0 h, and 12 h vs. 0 h, respectively. The number of up-regulated genes was greater than that of down-regulated in 3 h vs. 0 h, 6 h vs. 0 h, and 12 h vs. 0 h, which was consistent with the Arabidopsis transcriptome profile under various abiotic stresses [34].\n                        \n                      Fig. 2\n                          Number of DEGs at different time points after under alkaline stress compared with 0 h. Total number of up- (red bars) and down-regulated (blue bars) genes in leaves compared with the sample without stress (0 h)\n                        \n                Functional categorization of DEGs\n                  To further characterize the temporal expression changes under alkaline stress, GO enrichment analysis (P-value = 0.01) of DEGs found in the 3 h vs. 0 h, 6 h vs. 0 h, and 12 h vs. 0 h was conducted with the whole transcriptome as the background. Analysis revealed enrichment of GO terms related to cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes. Of the 186, 3211, and 8347 DEGs found in the 3 h vs. 0 h, 6 h vs. 0 h, and 12 h vs. 0 h comparison, respectively, 0, 24, and 72 DEGs were annotated in a GO cellular component category; 9, 146, and 307 DEGs were annotated in a GO molecular function ontology; and 11, 86, and 184 DEGs were annotated in a GO biological process category. For cellular component (Fig. 3), there was no gene annotated to the ontology term found in the 3 h vs. 0 h comparisons; whereas cell [16 (66.67%); 53 (73.61%)], cell part [16 (66.67%); 53 (73.61%)], intracellular part [13 (54.17%); 47 (65.28%)], and intracellular [13 (54.17%); 47 (65.28%)] were the most chasses for both the 6 h vs. 0 h, and 12 h vs. 0 h comparisons. In the molecular function group, as shown in Fig. 4, nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity (4, 44.44%) and sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity (4, 44.44%) were the two most highly represented categories in the 3 h vs. 0 h comparisons; for the 6 h vs. 0 h and 12 h vs. 0 h comparisons, the top categories were binding [70 (47.95%); 152 (65.28%)], catalytic activity [51 (34.93%); 106 (34.53%)], heterocyclic compound binding [38 (26.03%); 79 (27.73%)], and organic cyclic compound binding [38 (26.03%); 79 (27.73%)]. Under biological process, genes from the 3 h vs. 0 h comparison were most commonly annotated as single-organism metabolic process (5, 45.45%), oxylipin metabolic process (2, 18.18%), and oxylipin biosynthetic process (2, 18.18%). Similarly, metabolic process category [49 (56.98%); 101 (54.89%)], cellular process [28 (32.56%); 78 (42.39%)], organic substance metabolic process [29 (33.72%); 70 (38.04%)], and primary metabolic process [27 (31.40%); 63 (34.24%)] were the mostly highly enriched in 6 h vs. 0 h and 12 h vs. 0 h comparisons (Fig. 5).\n                        \n                      Fig. 3\n                          Comparative distribution of GO enrichment of terms related to cellular components\n                        \n                        \n                      Fig. 4\n                          Comparative distribution of GO enrichment of terms related to molecular function\n                        \n                        \n                      Fig. 5\n                          Comparative distribution of GO enrichment of terms related to biological processes\n                        \n                  The results of GO enrichment analysis showed that few genes were annotated with GO ontology terms in the 3 h vs. 0 h comparison. These GO ontology terms included only nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity and sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity in the molecular function group, and single-organism metabolic process, oxylipin metabolic process, and oxylipin biosynthetic process in the biological process group. These GO ontology terms showed the earliest response to alkaline stress and may generate a cascade responses following their induction at 3 h of alkaline stress treatment. Therefore, these genes may play an important role in early alkaline resistance mechanisms. With increasing duration of alkaline stress treatment, more DEGs were annotated with more GO terms, of which cell and cell part in the cellular component group, binding and catalytic activity in the molecular function group, and metabolic process category and cellular process in the biological process group were the most represented categories, suggesting that the internal tissues and organs of P. triloba had undergone multiple processes of anabolism to cope with and adapt to alkaline stress. It is noteworthy that 28 genes (c57635_g1_i1, c64583_g1_i1, c64900_g1_i1, c71351_g1_i1, c72539_g1_i1, c73498_g1_i4, c73839_g1_i2, c73869_g1_i2, c74641_g1_i1, c75112_g1_i1, c76093_g2_i1, c76646_g1_i1, c78345_g1_i1, c78766_g1_i1, c79591_g1_i1, c79591_g1_i2, c79591_g1_i3, c81104_g2_i1, c82384_g1_i1, c82500_g1_i1, c83082_g2_i1, c83291_g1_i3, c83618_g1_i4, c83799_g2_i1, c86513_g2_i1, c87340_g1_i1, c87510_g1_i2, c87918_g1_i2) as being involved in response to stimulus, indicating they may play a role in the alkaline stress response. KEGG annotation of these 28 genes revealed that c71351_g1_i1 is a RNA polymerase-associated protein, and c73869_g1_i2 is a HSP20 family protein. In the COG analysis of these stress-related genes, only five genes were involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (c73869_g1_i2, c74641_g1_i1, c78766_g1_i1), replication, recombination and repair (c82384_g1_i1), and nucleotide transport and metabolism (c83082_g2_i1). Therefore, there appears to be a link between the putative functions and annotations of these 28 genes and the alkaline stress response in P. triloba.\n                  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for DEGs was also conducted. There were several differences between the results of the KEGG analyses of the 3 h vs. 0 h genes, 6 h vs. 0 h genes, and 12 h vs. 0 h comparisons (Fig. 6). A total of 22, 403, and 1006 DEGs for 3 h vs. 0 h, 6 h vs. 0 h, and 12 h vs. 0 h comparison, respectively, were assigned to 42, 41, and 47 biological pathways. For 3 h vs. 0 h (Fig. 6), the largest categories were carbon metabolism (3, 13.64%), carbon fixation pathways in prokaryotes (3, 13.64%), terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (3, 13.64%), pyruvate metabolism (3, 13.64%), and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism (3, 13.64%). For 6 h vs. 0 h, as shown in Fig. 6, the top five most enriched pathway were carbon metabolism (37, 9.18%), starch and sucrose metabolism (23, 5.71%), plant-pathogen interaction (21, 5.21%), plant hormone signal transduction (20, 4.96%), and photosynthesis (20, 4.96%). In 47 assigned biological pathways of 12 h vs. 0 h comparison (Fig. 6), carbon metabolism pathway was also the most abundantly represented (77, 7.65%), followed by biosynthesis of amino acids (65, 6.46%), starch and sucrose metabolism (53, 5.27%), plant hormone signal transduction (46, 4.57%), and plant-pathogen interaction (41, 4.08%).\n                        \n                      Fig. 6\n                          KEGG enrichment analysis of the DEGs\n                        \n                  The results of KEGG pathways enrichment showed that metabolic pathway varied with different treatment durations. However, under alkaline stress treatment for 3 h, 6 h or 12 h, the following metabolic pathways were consistently involved: carbon metabolism; carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms; phenylpropanoid biosynthesis; glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; methane metabolism; pyruvate metabolism; glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism; terpenoid backbone biosynthesis; alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism; tryptophan metabolism; limonene and pinene degradation. Among these, the carbon metabolism pathway included the most DEGs, suggesting that P. triloba requires a large amount of energy in response to alkaline stress and that alkaline stress may primarily influence gene transcription by altering the expression of carbon metabolism-related genes in P. triloba. The pyruvate metabolism pathway involves many metabolic activities, such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fatty acid metabolism. When the plant is exposed to a harsh external environment, the pyruvate metabolism pathway can first effectively adjust and balance the metabolic processes in vivo, then activate protective mechanism, participate in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect the cell membrane system, thus allowing the plant to adapt to an adverse external environment [35]. The glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway can balance metabolic disorders and transport energy in plants to enhance stress resistance [35]. The alpha-linolenic acid metabolism pathway produces a series of metabolites, the most important of which are DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), as well as other polyunsaturated fatty acids. DHA and EPA increase lipid membrane fluidity and permeability and increase cells viability [36]. The tryptophan metabolism pathway produces secondary metabolites when the plant is subjected to abiotic stress, enhancing stress tolerance according to previous abiotic stress studies [37–39]. Therefore, the enrichment of DEGs in these metabolic pathways indicates that genes involved in early mechanisms of protection, defense, and stress tolerance were differentially expressed under alkaline stress treatment of 3 h. With increasing duration of alkaline stress, the number of related response genes increased, indicating that alkaline resistance in P. triloba is a complex train under the control of multiple genes. Some of the metabolic pathways only included DEGs after alkaline stress for a certain length of time. Under alkaline stress treatment for 3 h, one gene (c58505_g1_i1) was found to be involved in the calcium signaling pathway, and one gene (c89089_g2_i1) was involved in the ABC transporter pathway. The calcium signaling pathway is an important control pathway of physiological and biochemical reactions in vivo, and it can indirectly affect plant physiological activities (such as stomatal closure, the development of pollen tubes, root elongation, etc.), as confirmed by previous research [40]. The calcium signaling pathway was specifically identified after 3 h of alkaline stress treatment, when it may help P. triloba better cope with alkaline stress by changing intracellular calcium ion concentrations, leading to stomatal closure to avoid ion toxicity. ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters constitute the largest protein family with the greatest variety of functions, which may involve the transmembrane transport of plant secondary metabolites, protecting plants from environmental stresses [41]. The genes involved in these early specific pathways may play important roles in early alkaline resistance mechanisms and may generate a cascade of responses to subsequent alkaline stress. Under alkaline stress treatment for 6 and 12 h, more DEGs were involved in special metabolic pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, photosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and photosynthesis-antenna proteins. The above results showed that these genes that involved in metabolic pathways expressed with various patterns as the alkaline stress time increasing, and there was a rapid response of multiple molecular mechanisms allowing for the perception, transduction, and response to alkaline stress in P. triloba.\n                qRT-PCR validation of alkaline-related genes\n                  The reliability of the expression patterns of alkaline-responsive DEGs detected by RNA-Seq were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis with gene-specific primers. A subset of seven genes (c78498_g1_i1, c80260_g1_i1, c81662_g1_i1, c84090_g1_i1, c85502_g2_i1, c85846_g1_i3, and c88652_g1_i2) was selected, and the actin gene was used as an internal reference gene for data normalization. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that these seven genes were all up-regulated (Fig. 7), and most of expression patterns were consistent with those determined by qRT-PCR. Some differences in the expression patterns and degree of up-regulation of the alkaline-responsive DEGs were observed between RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR, which might be due to the different algorithms and principles used by the RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR methods [42, 43]. It is thought that it is normal to find a few differences between these two methods, and our results are of a similar nature to those reported in Yates [18] and Huang (2015) [44]. They found that some genes detected by RNA-Seq also did not show similar expression patterns when compared to qRT-PCR. Moreover, all seven genes were significantly and differentially expressed at all three durations of alkaline stress (P<0.05), suggesting that they were involved in regulatory networks that were active during these alkaline stress stages. Taken together, similar patterns were obtained from the qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq experiments, confirming the reliability and accuracy of our sequencing methods. And for important alkaline-responsive DEGs, we will use the Northern Blot to re-validate them in the future research.\n                        \n                      Fig. 7\n                          Expression patterns of seven genes selected from alkalinity-responsive DEGs of Prunus triloba by RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR. a Log2 fold change of expression was detected by RNA-Seq. b The relative gene expression was calculated using the 2-<U+25B3><U+25B3>Ct method by qRT-PCR. Mean values within the same gene with different letters are significantly at P<0.01\n                        \n                Physiological analysis of P. triloba in response to long-term alkaline stress\n                Effects of long-term alkaline stress on the leaf microstructure of P. triloba\n                           \n                  The leaf is the main organ for plant photosynthesis and transpiration, and its structural characteristics best reflect the adaptation of plants to the environment [45]. As shown in Fig. 8, the internal microstructures of the leaves of P. triloba changed under alkaline stress. Compared with the control group, the main changes in the P. triloba leaf structure that occurred under alkaline stress can summarized as follows: 1) the stomatal density of the lower epidermis greatly increased, the stomatal volume became smaller, and the stomata almost completely closed, in contrast to the control group whose stomata were semi-closed (Fig. 8a–b); 2) the upper and lower epidermal cells became slightly longer and narrower, and their arrangement became more irregular (Fig. 8c–d); 3) the thickness of the upper and lower epidermal cuticle increased (Fig. 8e–f); and 4) The leaf thickness increased, the mesophyll structure was more compact, the leaf chamber space was significantly reduced, the palisade tissue cells became slender, the spongy tissue cells became smaller, and the thickness ratio of palisade tissue to spongy tissue increased (Fig. 8g–h).\n                        \n                      Fig. 8\n                          Effects of control and alkaline stress treatments on leaf microstructure of Prunus triloba. a, c, e, g represent the leaf stomata, upper epidermis cell, cuticle, and vertical section in the control group, repectively. b, d, f, h represent the leaf stomata, upper epidermis cell, cuticle, and vertical section in the alkaline stress group, repectively\n                        \n                  Alkaline stress can directly affect the water metabolism of plants. It is accepted that the larger area of the epidermal cells have a better water storage, which has an important significance in enhancing the regulation of water. The epidermal cuticle can prevent excessive water transpiration inside the plant and it has an important role in the mechanical support of epidermal cells; therefore, when the plant water supply is insufficient, it keeps plant tissues from withering rapidly [46]. The highly developed palisade tissue not only helps mesophyll cells avoid scorching from strong sunlight but also effectively uses diffracted light for photosynthesis. Thicker, smaller, and more densely arranged palisade tissue cells result in a higher energy utilization efficiency in plants [46, 47]. Therefore, in this study, the leaf structural changes observed in P. triloba, including enlargement of the leaf epidermal cell area, thickening of the epidermal cuticle and palisade tissue, and transition to a denser arrangement of palisade tissue, reflect the plant’s responses to long-term alkaline stress.\n                Effects of long-term alkaline stress on P. triloba seedling physiological indices\n                  It is widely accepted that under alkaline stress, plants not only bear the same osmotic stress and ion toxicity as those under salt stress, but they also must resist damage due to high pH. In this study, P. triloba seedlings were continuously treated with 50 mmol/L alkaline solution for 0, 3, 6, 9, or 12 days. Leaf samples collected under alkaline stress of different durations were used to measure various physiological indices in order to explore the physiological adaptation mechanisms of early P. triloba seedlings under alkaline stress. The RWC is the most direct reflection of the degree of injury to seedlings under alkaline stress. The RWC of leaves declined gradually from 82.11 to 51.24% with increasing duration of alkaline stress, indicating that the cell was becoming more and more dehydrated and damage was increasing as alkaline stress continued (Fig. 9a).\n                        \n                      Fig. 9\n                          Effects of alkaline stress on seedling physiological indices of Prunus triloba. The x-axis represents the time (d) under alkaline stress, the y-axis are the various number of physiological indices, of which (a) The relative water content (RWC, %); b Soluble protein content (SPC, mg/g FW); c Soluble sugar content (SSC, mg/g); d Procontnet content (Pro, µg/g); e The activity of peroxidase (POD, µ/g FW. min); f The activity of catalase (CAT, µ/g FW); g The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD, µ/g FW); h Relative electric conductivity (REC, %); i Malonaldehyde content (MDA, µm/g FW); j Total chlorophyll content (Chl, mg/g FW)\n                        \n                  Osmotic stress in plants is due to loss of water or difficulty in absorbing water, so the osmotic regulation of plant cells is a basic adaptation that improves stress tolerance [48]. Osmotic protective substances produced in the cytoplasm are induced by saline-alkaline stress and consist mainly of low-molecular-weight cell-compatible organic substances (i.e. soluble sugars, soluble proteins, and proline); these maintain the proper osmotic potential of the cell, protecting it from dehydration and stabilizing the structure and function of biological macromolecules in cells [49]. In this study, the SSC, SPC, and Pro content increased with increasing stress duration (Fig. 9b–d).\n                  After osmotic stress and ion toxicity, further damage in plants is caused by saline-alkaline stress due to excessive accumulation of ROS, resulting in lipid peroxidation or even cell death [50]. Our results suggested that 50 mmol/L alkaline solution induced the accumulation of ROS and the oxidative damage of membrane lipids in P. triloba seedlings and that the extent of the damage increased with an increasing duration of alkaline stress. The antioxidant systems of plants evolved to play an important role in defending against damage caused by ROS [51]. The protective enzymes in the enzyme-promoting defense system, including SOD, POD, and CAT, are particularly important. As shown in Fig. 9e–g, the activities of SOD, POD, and CAT in the leaves of P. triloba seedlings all increased with an increasing duration of alkaline stress. The biggest increase in activity was exhibited by POD, followed by SOD and then CAT, suggesting that POD played the primary role in resisting oxidative damage induced by alkaline stress.\n                  The protoplasmic membrane is sensitive to the stress reaction, and an increase in cell membrane permeability is closely related to an adverse external environment [52]. The REC is an indicator of cell membrane permeability, and it can reflect the degree of cell membrane damage [53]. Moreover, MDA is produced during cell membrane lipid peroxidation. The MDA content can therefore reflect the degree of oxidative damage in an organism [54]. Our results showed that as the duration of alkaline stress increased, leaf REC and MDA content both increased gradually (Fig. 9h–i), indicating that plant damage was becoming more severe. MDA not only has a cytotoxic effect by damaging cell membrane structure, but it can also degrade chlorophyll, thereby reducing plant photosynthesis [55]. The Chl content in this study decreased gradually, from 5.492 to 2.304 mg/g, as the duration of alkaline stress increased (Fig. 9j). This may be due to the increasing MDA content, which may have inhibited the synthesis of chlorophyll.\n                Effects of long-term alkaline stress on P. triloba seedling photosynthetic parameters\n                  The chlorophyll content is an important parameter that reflects the photosynthetic function of leaves. As mentioned above, the Chl content declined gradually with increasing stress duration. In addition, other photosynthetic parameters declined after 12 days of alkaline stress, including Pn, Gs, Ci, and Tr. Among these parameters, Gs is closely related to the photosynthetic rate of plants. In most cases, a decline in Gs leads to a decrease in CO2 supply, causing a reduction in the photosynthetic rate [56]. Our results showed that the Pn rate and Gs of leaves of experimental and control seedlings presented similar bimodal changes as the duration of stress increased (Fig. 10a–b), demonstrating that the change in the Pn rate was largely determined by stomatal elements.\n                        \n                      Fig. 10\n                          Effects of alkaline stress on seedling photosynthetic characteristics of Prunus triloba. The x-axis represents the measured time (h), the y-axis are the photosynthetic parameters content of the control and treatment materials, of which (a) Net photosynthetic rate (Pn, µmol· m-2· s-1); b Stomatal conductance (Gs, mmol· m-2· s-1); c Intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci, µL· L-1); d Transpiration rate (Tr, mmol· m-2· s-1); e Water use efficiency (WUE, Pn/Tr). The red smooth curve in the picture represents the control material, whereas the blue smooth curve represents the treatment material\n                        \n                  As shown in Fig. 10d, the leaf Tr of the alkaline-stressed and control seedlings first increased and then decreased, peaking at 11:00 and 13:00, respectively, and exhibiting similar but also different trends compared with that of Pn rate and Gs. The change in Ci under alkaline stress was similar to that in the control group, which is inconsistent with the corresponding trend of the Pn rate (Fig. 10c). At some time points, the Ci and Pn rate showed similar trends (both increasing or both decreasing), while at other time points, the Ci and Pn rate exhibited opposite trends, suggesting that the decrease in the Pn rate was not only due to a stomatal limitation but was also restricted by non-stomatal factors. WUE is a comprehensive physiological and ecological index that reflects crop energy conversion efficiency in crop production and assesses crop growth suitability. The WUE at the single leaf level is often expressed as the ratio of the Pn rate to the Tr [57]. The trend in the WUE of the leaves of P. triloba seedlings was consistent with that of the Pn rate both in the control and alkaline stress treatments (Fig. 10e). However, the alkaline stress treatment increased the WUE in P. triloba leaves, a phenomenon that needed to be explained by further research.\n                ConclusionIn this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of alkaline acclimation mechanisms in P. triloba. First, de novo transcriptome analysis of P. triloba was conducted in response to short-term alkaline stress using the Illumina sequencing platform. We identified a large number of DEGs that may be used for molecular breeding of P. triloba in the future. GO annotation analysis revealed 28 DEGs that may play an important role in the early alkaline stress response, and KEGG pathway analysis revealed a variety of pathways that may be important at different time points. In addition, the expression patterns of seven alkaline-related genes were validated with qRT-PCR, confirming the reliability of the RNA-Seq results. Second, a physiological analysis of P. triloba in response to long-term alkaline stress was also conducted. Changes in the internal microstructure of the leaves, physiological indices, and photosynthetic parameters of P. triloba under alkaline stress were observed, allowing P. triloba to adapt to long-term alkaline stress. Our study provides information on the short-term molecular mechanisms and long-term physiological mechanisms of alkaline tolerance in P. triloba that can be used to study this plant as well as other fruit trees in the future.Abbreviations\n                CAT: \n                    Catalase\n                  Chl: \n                    Chlorophyll content\n                  Ci: \n                    Internal CO2 concentration\n                  DEGs: \n                    Differentially expressed genes\n                  FDR: \n                    False discovery rate\n                  GO: \n                    Gene ontology\n                  Gs: \n                    Stomatal conductance\n                  KEGG: \n                    Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes\n                  MDA: \n                    Malondialdehyde content\n                  Pn: \n                    Net photosynthetic rate\n                  POD: \n                    Peroxidase\n                  Pro: \n                    Proline content\n                  qRT-PCR: \n                    Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR\n                  REC: \n                    Relative electrical conductivity\n                  RWC: \n                    Relative water content\n                  SNP: \n                    Single nucleotide polymorphism\n                  SOD: \n                    Superoxide dismutase\n                  SPC: \n                    Soluble protein content\n                  SSC: \n                    Soluble sugar content\n                  SSR: \n                    Simple sequence repeat\n                  Tr: \n                    Transpiration rate\n                  WUE: \n                    Water use efficiency\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsWe thank all the participants for their contributions to this study.

However, with the discovery of gene expression waves in vertebrate segmentation, another paradigm based on oscillations linked to axial growth was established. The Notch pathway and hairy delay oscillator are basic components of this mechanism, as is the wnt pathway. With the establishment of oscillations during segmentation of the beetle Tribolium, a common segmentation mechanism may have been present in the last common ancestor of vertebrates and arthropods. However, the Notch pathway is not involved in segmentation of the initial Drosophila embryo. In arthropods, the engrailed, wingless pair has a much more conserved function in segmentation than most of the hierarchy established for Drosophila.\n                        \n              \n                Results\n                Here, we work backwards from this conserved pair by discussing possible mechanisms which could have taken over the role of the Notch pathway. We propose a pivotal role for the large transmembrane protein Ten-m/Odz. Ten-m/Odz may have had an ancient role in cell-cell communication, parallel to the Notch and wnt pathways. The Ten-m protein binds to the membrane with properties which resemble other membrane-based biochemical oscillators.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                We propose that such a simple transition could have formed the initial scaffold, on top of which the hierarchy, observed in the syncytium of dipterans, could have evolved.\n              KeywordsSegmentationCambrian explosionChemical oscillationsTen-mFtzBackgroundThe idea that segmentation arose well before the Cambrian explosion, even before the last common ancestor of vertebrates and arthropods, has recently been under discussion [1–6]. For more than a decade, in attempts to understand sequential segmentation in other arthropods, the paradigm for Drosophila segmentation was used to explain the mechanisms of sequential segmentation. In parallel, other mechanisms proposed for vertebrates emerged, representing an alternative paradigm and being probably even closer related to sequential segmentation [3, 7–9].At nuclear cycle 10 to 14, the Drosophila embryo is a syncytium with nuclei dividing in a layer close to the outer membrane. Since no cell walls have formed yet, protein gradients can arise through diffusion or active transport. Indeed, a hierarchy of such gradients gradually pattern the embryo [1, 2, 4, 10–12]. Maternal gradients from both ends of the embryo determine the locations of the proteins of the next level of the hierarchy, the gap genes. These arise in broad bands, and maternal and gap proteins in turn define region specific cues. At the next level of the hierarchy, the pair-rule genes are controlled by a combination of the gap genes, and the result is the emergence of the first repetitive pattern in the embryo, the seven striped pair-rule patterns of genes such as hairy (h), even-skipped (eve) and runt (run). The pair-rule genes define the final level of the hierarchy, that of the segment-polarity genes such as wingless (wg) and (engrailed) (en), which emerge as 14 stripes, while cellularization is in progress. During this process, a membrane moves from the apical to the basal side of the nuclei and finally encases them.In vertebrates, a completely different mode operates during segmentation. Periodically-arising gene-expression waves, first established in chicken embryos [7], arise from the elongating posterior end of the embryo and run towards the anterior where they gradually stop, thereby adding a segment per period. Subsequently, this was interpreted as an oscillation under control of the chicken Hairy protein. This protein binds to its own promoter and inhibits its own activity, but due to a delay between formation of the corresponding mRNA and the protein, a biochemical oscillator emerges [13]. At the posterior end, cells are converted into the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) during the oscillation mode (Fig. 1). As the embryo elongates axially, new oscillating cells emerge in the PSM with varying phases. Eventually, the period of oscillation of an individual cell becomes larger, until the oscillation eventually stops and segment borders form. This process repeats itself when the next group of cells come to a halt during their oscillation, and thus segments form sequentially (from anterior towards posterior).\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Somite formation in the oscillator-growth scenario. a a vertical embryo is depicted, with anterior head above and posterior tail region below, where the growth zone is located. The presomitic mesoderm (PSM) is the region from the last already-formed somite to the growth zone at the posterior PSM boundary. The time evolution of newly formed cells at the growth zone is depicted in (b) as the horizontal black bar. Initially, a gene expression, depicted as a grey time box, oscillates in time (with a period of three time-boxes, left part of black bar). Eventually (right part of the horizontal bar), the period increases to more than six time boxes, (and even more, see Fig. 5a) and the oscillation thus comes almost to a halt. A bistable system freezes this gene expression in the (almost) stopped phase, somite boundaries start to form and a new mature somite is created, depicted as a circle. Thus somites are added in an anterior to posterior direction, with control from the posterior part of the embryo. Reproduced from [58]\n                    How the periodic spatial pattern generated by gene-expression waves are translated into actual somites is still a matter of discussion. The high and low protein concentrations must interfere with a bistable mechanism which is capable of storing these phases. The same problem arises in arthropod segmentation. In Drosophila, the wg, en and (hedgehog) hh module maintains the spatial pattern once formed [14].The essential traits of the vertebrate segmentation paradigm is an oscillator coupled to axial growth, slowing of the oscillation, and stabilization by a bistable switch. Although often referred to as a ‘clock-and-wave front’ mechanism, the original CW-model [15] was assigned a role for the control of segmentation from the anterior part of the embryo. However, a modification proposed by Newman with a clock running in the posterior growth zone, with the period frozen when cells entered the PSM [16], is closer to our current thinking. Indeed, this mechanism may be relatively easy to achieve initially during early evolution. This mechanism would yield almost instantly-formed metameric units emanating from the posterior end. However, if there was an advantage of showing the freezing of the oscillation phase postponed, a control system could gradually evolve to achieve this feature.The Notch pathway was shown to be involved in spider segmentation (a basal arthropod) [17]. This report opened a new door to arthropod segmentation. It was speculated that this mechanism of segmentation may have been ancestral, predating the last common ancestor of vertebrates and arthropods. This argument was further strengthened by the establishment of an important role for the Notch pathway in cockroach and cricket segmentation [18, 19]. Somewhat later, a role for Notch at the root of insects for segmentation of the crustacean Artemia franciscana was reported [20]. However, the reports on the significance of the Notch pathway in arthropod segmentation were recently challenged again [21–23].Recently, further progress in understanding oscillator mechanisms in arthropods was made by the demonstration of the existence of a segmentation clock in the odd-skipped (odd) and eve gens in the flour beetle Tribolium which supports the notion of a clock-based mechanism in both vertebrates and arthropods [24–26].However, a common clock based on the Notch pathway must have been lost in the evolution of insects, as the Notch pathway is not involved in early embryonic segmentation in Drosophila, although it is involved later during development in segmentation of the appendages. Likewise, Notch signaling does not regulate early segmentation in the honeybee, a basal holometabolous insect [27].The role of the Notch pathway was originally described to have a share in the oscillating mechanism, but alternatively, it may function to signal locally between cells, thus synchronizing these [28]. Differences exist between zebrafish, chick and mouse somitogenesis, but the essential feature is an oscillator system coupled to axial growth. An interplay between the Notch, wnt and FGF pathways was established [29, 30], however, recent results indicated that a component was missing in the oscillating mechanism [8, 31, 32].The vertebrate segmentation paradigm introduces another framework for evaluating experimental data of basal sequential insect segmentation which otherwise were interpreted to comply one way or another with the Drosophila paradigm. Notably, some of the gap genes may be involved in axial elongation, rather than defining zones of segments. Truncation may occur [33, 34], but truncation may also be due to misregulation of pair-rule genes. A reinterpretation of the role of gap genes, however, does not give any clear answers [4]. The role of the primary pair-rule genes is quite variable, sometimes revealing a pair- rule function, sometimes a function like segment-polarity genes, sometimes neither of these [35–37]. The wg, en and hh module has a much more conserved function in defining segment borders. The observation that many pair-rule genes also harbor regulatory elements for segmental expression led to the (meanwhile) revised conclusion that the most widely-conserved role of the pair-rule genes may be at the single-segment level, and not at the double-segment level [2, 35, 38].In this context, it is noteworthy to mention that not all insects follow the same mode of segmentation. In Drosophila, the patterns of expression of segmentation genes are established simultaneously in all segments by a complex set of interactions between transcriptional factors that diffuse in a syncytium occupying the whole embryo [39, 40]. Such mechanisms cannot act in short germ-band insects such as the grasshopper Schistocerca where the blastoderm initially comprises only one segment, and the remaining segments are sequentially produced from a posterior proliferative zone. The most widespread mode of segmentation among insects is found in the intermediate germ-band organisms such as Tribolium, where a species-specific number of segments forms synchronously from an anteriorly restricted blastoderm, whereas the other tissues form sequentially from a posterior proliferative zone.The nature of the oscillator which could play the role as a possible replacement for the Notch pathway is still unsolved. We wish to propose an alternative mechanism. To this end, we worked backwards from the wg, en, hh module and searched for genes functionally close to this module which could have a role as a presumptive oscillator and at the same time showing a function in cell-cell communication. We wish to argue that the ten-m gene [41] (also called odz [42]) has many properties which may place this gene in a central role for ancient segmentation, and possibly in arthropod segmentation, as well. ten-m is involved in segmentation in both vertebrates and insects [43]. This gene encodes a large type II transmembrane protein which is bound to the cell membrane. In Drosophila, it is located on the inwards-growing membrane which intercalates the nuclei in the syncytium. A long extracellular part of the protein is involved in homodimerization, and the dynamics of this process has properties which may create a biochemical oscillator. Homophilic interactions of Ten-m on the membrane eventually induce cleavage of Ten-m on the intracellular small part, which translocates to the nucleus. A link between ten-m and zic, the vertebrate homolog of odd-paired (opa), was discussed [44]. In Drosophila, ten-m is not transcribed in pair-rule stripes, rather the mRNA is expressed fairly homogeneous, but after translation the protein forms seven stripes at early gastrulation ([41], Fig. 6). The mechanism for this observation is so far unexplained, but we propose that the internal dynamics of the protein-membrane interactions will set up a spontaneous pattern-forming mechanism, well known from similar biochemical control systems. Interestingly, despite the fact that it shows a striped expression, ten-m mutants show a normal cuticle, however, most ten-m mutants die at the first larval stage [45].The role of the equidistantly-striped Ten-m protein in Drosophila is presently unknown. However, the presence of the stripes during late cycle 14 and early gastrulation is early enough to provide an equidistantly striped pattern, which may complement the broad subdivision provided by gap gene cues.We wish to propose that the oscillatory properties of Ten-m may play a seminal role in arthropod segmentation. Finally, we propose a mechanism by which Ten-m would play an important role in cell-cell communication and in axial sequential segmentation in lower arthropods, by a simple parameter change in the control system to an all-at-once pattern forming mechanism. We propose that such a simple transition could have formed the initial scaffold, on top of which the hierarchy, observed in the syncytium of dipterans, could have evolved.ResultsMembrane oscillator and bistability\n                The vertebrate oscillator, coupled to axial growth, was proposed to arise from self-inhibition of the Hairy protein which binds to its own promoter [13]. Thus, synthesis of hairy mRNA is inhibited by Hairy protein, which is itself translated from the mRNA. Such a two-component inhibitory feedback system is only an oscillator, if a delay is invoked in the mechanism.\n                Our proposed Ten-m oscillator does not have its origin in a delayed translation, but arises from cooperative membrane binding. After transcription and translation, the Ten-m protein in the cytoplasm binds to the cell membrane. Subsequently, the bound form in the membrane reacts to create homodimers. If the uptake to the membrane is enhanced in regions with homodimers, cooperative binding of the cytoplasmic form will take place. We presume cooperative binding in our model, presented in the section “Models” below.\n                The homodimers are known to induce cleavage of the intracellular short part of the protein, perhaps through interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases. In vertebrates, it was found that the short part of the protein translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional repressor of zic, a vertebrate homologue of opa [44]. Conversely, ubiquitous Zic causes rapid degradation in the cytoplasm of the short intra Ten-m. In the manuscript, we refer to opa/zic where appropriate for the convenience of the reader. Through modeling of the described cooperative binding of Ten-m to the membrane accompanied with subsequent degradation, it is observed that a biochemical oscillator can emerge (Fig. 2). The model is described in detail in the section “Models”, where parameters are discussed.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        The Ten-m oscillator. In the mathematical model, Eqs. (3,4), k\n                                       2\n                           is varied from 0.75 to l/100th of this, simulating control from FGF8.

The result is a relatively rapid oscillation at first, with T\n                                       p\n                           = 10.5, but gradually, the period grows and reaches values of ~ 10 times larger than in the beginning. In experimentally observed gene expression waves, the period grows with a factor of about 6, after which the oscillation is trapped by a bistable system\n                      \n                In vertebrates, it was shown that a protein gradient of FGF8 emerges due to fgf8 transcription in the posterior growth zone and subsequent mRNA degradation within cells in the PSM [46, 47]. This gradient causes the oscillation to cycle slower. A similar gradient of Wnt is also present. However, none of the three signaling Notch, wnt or FGF pathways, when activated in the PSM individually, appear to act as the global pacemaker [31, 32]. Links between the Notch, wnt and FGF8 pathways were suggested and modeled [8, 29]. FGF8 is also coupled to the role of ten-m in vertebrate limb formation and possibly in segmentation as well [43, 48]. However, the mechanism of how to slow down the period of the oscillation is still unsolved [43]. Recently, however, it was shown that intercellular coupling through the Delta-Notch pathway has some role in the regulation of the period [49].\n                The region where the phase of the slowed down oscillator becomes fixed (the so-called determination front in vertebrates) is coupled to opposing retinoic acid and FGF gradients, but the link to a bistable system is not well established in vertebrates (see [50] for a model). Nonlinear bistable biochemical switches generally have the property that their dynamics allow two mutually-exclusive stable stationary states, one in which a component A is high and another component B is low, and another with high B and low A. The dynamics may be such that the module has only one (possibly symmetrical) state, if a control parameter is below a critical threshold, but enters the bistable regime when the control parameter exceeds the threshold. Which of the two states is then selected (high A, low B or vice versa) depends on small fluctuations in the dynamics. If the system is biased beforehand towards an excess of, say A, then entering the bistable regime with the control parameter exceeding the threshold will select the high A/low B state. Thus, if the gene expression oscillator is coupled to such a bistable system, and the slow-down of the oscillation occurs in cells which have entered the bistable regime, then the phase of the oscillator may bias the bistable system to select (and maintain) this phase for subsequent times.\n              Period doubling\n                It is a commonly observed feature of autonomous nonlinear oscillators that a phenomenon known as period-doubling occurs [51]. The phenomenon may arise in several ways, e.g. if more than one oscillator is present and coupled, or a delay or a feedback in the mechanism is introduced [52]. Whereas the original system may have regular peaks entering with period T\n                           0\n                  , the coupled system may modify the oscillation such that only every other peak emerges with high amplitude, whereas in between, the former high peaks are somewhat reduced, (Fig. 3). The system is still periodic, but now with a period closer to 2<U+2009>T\n                           0\n                  . Such a system would still give rise to a full set of segments laid down with period T\n                           0\n                  , but the higher period-2 peaks should be capable of triggering the bistable stabilizing system well before the smaller peaks in between. In the axially-growing embryo, one would then observe gene activation in a double segment periodicity, and somewhat later complemented with intercalating gene activation in between the first wave of stripes.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Period 2 oscillation. a a normal oscillator is seen. Concentration oscillates with a period T\n                                       a\n                           of about 4.5 time units. b the system has undergone period-doubling. Former high peaks with period T\n                                       a\n                           are replaced by high peaks only at every second peak, with a lower intercalating peak\n                      \n                Such a control system could even be used as a scaffold for separating the promoter control for the first wave of stripes with double-segment periodicity, and the second wave of intercalary stripes. Note also that genes involved in such an oscillator system may easily change roles (by small parameter changes in the control) from a ‘segment polarity gene’ (oscillator with period T\n                           0\n                  ) to a ‘pair-rule gene’ (period doubled oscillator with period 2<U+2009>T\n                           0\n                  ), and even to a gene not involved in stripe formation (parameter change of the control system to a non-oscillatory regime). Thus, the apparent variability of the function of primary pair-rule genes such as eve in lower arthropods, with pair-rule expression only (but not segmental expression), segmental only, both kind of expressions or neither of them [35–37] can be controlled by minor changes in the oscillator control system.\n                The possible relevance of the phenomenon of period-doubling in oscillating systems, as outlined above, has not been implemented in an explicit model by us, since presumptive couplings of the ten-m oscillator to other autonomous oscillators (like those in the Notch, Wnt and FGF pathways) are so far a matter for future research.\n                In the next section, we discuss the quantitative aspects of the proposed oscillator, based on cooperative Ten-m binding to the membrane.\n              Models\n                The dynamics of Ten-m is described in analogy with an earlier model by [53], which is further akin to a model by [54] on protein binding to the cell membrane, in the context of prokaryotic cell division. The main feature of this model has been experimentally verified with in vitro experiments and further modeling [55].\n                We will use linear stability theory to show that the model comprises an autonomous oscillator, and find parameters relevant to the onset of oscillations. Generally, such an analysis may be performed by a linearization of the proposed rate-laws. From the elements a, b, c, d of the Jacobian (see below), one obtains the characteristic equation$$ {\\lambda}^2+ T r\\lambda + det=0 $$ (1)\n                        \n                with Tr = a + d and det = ad — bc. The eigenvalues \\( \\lambda \\) found determine the fate of small perturbations from the stationary state: if the real part of \\( \\lambda \\) is found negative, the perturbations relax or spiral into the stationary state, and the system is locally stable. If the real part is positive, the perturbations are amplified, and the stationary state is locally unstable. The conditions Tr < 0 and det > 0 together guaranty local stability, according to the general theory. Onset of oscillations may occur if the condition Tr < 0 is violated. At the transition (where Tr = 0), Eq. (1) becomes$$ {\\lambda}^2+ det=0 $$ (2)\n                        \n                The imaginary part Im of \\( \\lambda \\) is thus vdet which allows solutions of the perturbations of the form cos(Imt). From this the period, T\n                           p\n                   of these oscillations can be determined since 2\\( \\pi \\)= ImT\n                           p\n                  =v detT\n                           p\n                  .\n                Thus, in our model we use$$ x'={k}_1\\hbox{--} 2{k}_2 x{y}^{\\gamma} $$ (3)\n                           $$ y'={k}_2 x{y}^{\\gamma}\\hbox{--} {k}_3 y $$ (4)\n                        \n                Here, x is the cytoplasmic concentration of the Ten-m protein, and y is its membrane-bound dimer. We assume a constant rate k\n                           1\n                   of synthesis of x, and a Hill-type uptake-rate proportional to y\n                           <U+03B3>\n                  /(L<U+2009>+<U+2009>y\n                           <U+03B3>\n                  ), in analogy with the above models. For simplicity, we only keep the nominator in order to find analytical expressions for parameter values at the onset of oscillation or pattern formation. A new feature is the introduction of Hill-type degradation of y as well, so we rewrite k\n                           3y to k\n                           3y\n                           m\n                  .\n                The elements of the Jacobian evaluates to$$ a=\\delta \\left({x}^{\\prime}\\right)/\\delta (x)=-2{k}_2{y}^{\\gamma} $$ (5)\n                           $$ b=\\delta \\left({x}^{\\prime}\\right)/\\delta (y)=-2{k}_2 x\\gamma {y}^{\\left(\\gamma -1\\right)} $$ (6)\n                           $$ c=\\delta \\left({y}^{\\prime}\\right)/\\delta (x)={k}_2{y}^{\\gamma} $$ (7)\n                           $$ d=\\delta \\left({y}^{\\prime}\\right)/\\delta (y)={k}_2\\gamma x{y}^{\\left(\\gamma -1\\right)}-{k}_2 m{y}^{\\left( m-1\\right)} $$ (8)\n                        \n                The determinand of the Jacobian det = (ad-bc) evaluated at the stationary state yields$$ det=\\left(-2{k}_2{y}^{\\gamma}\\right)\\left({k}_2\\gamma x{y}^{\\left(\\gamma -1\\right)}-{k}_3 m{y}^{\\left( m-1\\right)}\\right)-\\left(-2{k}_2\\gamma x{y}^{\\left(\\gamma -1\\right)}{k}_2{y}^{\\gamma}\\right)=2{k}_2{k}_3 m{\\left(\\frac{\\left({k}_1\\right)}{\\left(2{k}_3\\right)}\\right)}^{\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\gamma -1\\right)}{m}\\right)}\\frac{k_1}{\\left(2{k}_3\\right)}={k}_1{k}_2 m{\\left(\\frac{k_1}{\\left(2{k}_3\\right)}\\right)}^{\\left(\\left(\\gamma -1\\right)/ m\\right)} $$ (9)\n                        \n                where$$ {y}^m=\\frac{k_1}{\\left(2{k}_3\\right)} $$ (10)\n                        \n                and the two terms with xy\n                           (<U+03B3>-1) cancel each other. The determinand is thus always positive.\n                The system will be an oscillator provided$$ T r= a+ d=-2{k}_2{y}^{\\gamma}+{k}_2 x\\gamma {y}^{\\left(\\gamma -1\\right)}-{k}_3 m{y}^{\\left( m-1\\right)}>0 $$ (11)\n                        \n                Multiplying with y\n                           $$ -2{k}_2{y}^{\\left(\\gamma +1\\right)}+{k}_2 x\\gamma {y}^{\\gamma}-{k}_3 m{y}^m>0 $$ (12)\n                        \n                and thus$$ {k}_2\\gamma \\frac{k_1}{\\left(2{k}_2\\right)}>2{k}_2{\\left(\\frac{k_1}{\\left(2{k}_3\\right)}\\right)}^{\\left(\\left(\\gamma +1\\right)/ m\\right)}+ m\\left({k}_1/2\\right)>0 $$ (13)\n                        \n                which yields$$ \\gamma - m>4\\frac{k_2}{k_1}{\\left(\\frac{k_1}{\\left(2{k}_3\\right)}\\right)}^{\\left(\\left(\\gamma +1\\right)/ m\\right)} $$ (14)\n                        \n                and thus a positive value for the difference <U+03B3> -m in cooperativity.\n                This may be rearranged to$$ {k}_3>{k}_{3 c}=\\frac{k_1}{2}{\\left(4\\frac{k_2}{\\left({k}_1\\left(\\gamma - m\\right)\\right)}\\right)}^{\\left( m/\\left(\\gamma +1\\right)\\right)} $$ (15)\n                        \n                The period T\n                           p\n                   of this oscillation may be estimated for k\n                           3 > k\n                           3c\n                            (i.e. close to the Hopf bifurcation point) from the value of the determinand as$$ {T}_p\\simeq 2\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{(det)}}=\\frac{\\left(2\\pi \\right)}{{\\left( m{k}_1{k}_2\\right)}^{\\left(1/2\\right)}}{\\left(\\frac{\\left(4{k}_2\\right)}{\\left({k}_1\\left(\\gamma - m\\right)\\right)}\\right)}^{\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\gamma -1\\right)}{\\left(2\\left(\\gamma +1\\right)\\right)}\\right)} $$ (16)\n                        \n                One desired property of oscillators related to sequential segmentation is that the control of the period (e.g. by a gradient in FGF8, see main text) should be feasible without changing too many parameters drastically simultaneously. In principle, FGF8 could decrease all three reaction constants k\n                           1\n                  , k\n                           2\n                   and k\n                           3\n                   with the same magnitude. In this case, Eqs. (3) and (4) simply rescale to a new time. In reality, this seems highly implausible. To increase T\n                           p\n                   with only a major change in one parameter, but modest changes in the rest is more difficult to achieve. For example, only increasing k\n                           3\n                   to a value far from the bifurcation point may lead to a long period, but simultaneously to a high- amplitude, highly nonlinear saw-tooth type oscillation.\n                However, from the expression Eq. (13), the power (\\( \\gamma \\) — l)/(2(\\( \\gamma \\) + 1)) evaluates to 1/6 for a realistic Hill constant \\( \\gamma \\) = 2. This means that the argument \\( \\eta \\) \n                           = 4 k\n                           2\n                  /k\n                           1\n                   (\\( \\gamma \\) — m)) raised to this power may change relatively modestly. Indeed, due to the front factor 2p/(mk\n                           1\n                  k\n                           2\n                  )1/2\n                           , the period T\n                           p\n                   becomes largely inversely proportional to the square root of k\n                           2\n                   and thus decreasing k\n                           2\n                   a factor of 25 from, say, 0.5 to 0.02 would result in a five-fold increase in the period, provided <U+03B7>\n                           1/6 does not change much. If the cooperatively m approaches \\( \\gamma \\) in this transition, <U+03B7>\n                           1/6 would change even less.\n                It is thus possible to increase the period with a constant k\n                           1\n                  , a substantial (FGF8-induced) change in k\n                           2\n                   and a modest increase in the degradation cooperativity m from, say, 1.25 to a value closer to \\( \\gamma \\) = 2 such that \\( \\eta \\) does not change a lot. Hereby, the degradation rate constant k\n                           3\n                   may also remain almost constant. A simulation of this increase in oscillation period by control of k\n                           2\n                   is given in Fig. 2.\n                Our assumptions of the changing constants may appear odd at first. But starting from a Newman type mechanism with instant freezing of the phase of the oscillator, when cells enter the PSM (see above), it is possible to have gradual improvements during evolution towards a mechanism with oscillator slow-down. There is probably an advantage, although hitherto not discussed in the literature, to have a gradual slow-down of the oscillator along the PSM, instead of instant freezing. In our model, the sigmoid form of degradation could evolve from a simple first-order kinetics, but with a Hill constant m always lower than \\( \\gamma \\) (otherwise oscillations stop, as shown). [56] describes an example of such a cooperative degradation. This would lengthen the period, but to achieve an increase of the period with as much as a factor 6 (as in Fig. 2), k\n                           3\n                   has to be changed modestly as well, if large amplitudes are to be avoided. However, when k\n                           2\n                   is decreased, a decrease in \\( \\gamma \\) — m (i.e. m approaching \\( \\gamma \\)) to about the value of the diminished k\n                           2\n                   would keep k\n                           3\n                   virtually constant. Such a scenario is possible during evolution, as it is a gradual process retaining the oscillatory dynamics throughout.\n                As eluted above, metameric structures are possible in an oscillator-growth scenario based on Ten-m. The transition from such a sequential stripe-forming mechanism to an all-or-none Turing mechanism may first require a syncytium. The advantage of a syncytium has not been much discussed in the literature, except for the observation that pattern formation may be much faster, if diffusion in a common cytoplasm replaces cell-cell communication. A role for a syncytium in an oscillator-growth scenario may also be ascribed to the need for local synchronization of the oscillators.\n                The transition from sequential to all-or-none stripe formation may be discussed in terms of the Turing wave length of the syncytial system. Here, x is the rapidly diffusing cytoplasmic component, while y is the membrane-bound slowly diffusing species. The characteristic wave length \\( \\lambda \\)\n                           T\n                   of such a system is <U+03BB>\n                           T\n                  <U+2009>=<U+2009>2p/<U+03BA>\n                           T\n                   with n\n                           T\n                   [57] and is given by$$ {\\kappa}_T^2=\\frac{\\left( a{D}_y+ d{D}_x\\right)}{\\left(2{D}_x{D}_y\\right)} $$ (17)\n                        \n                with D\n                           x\n                   and D\n                           y\n                   the diffusion coefficients of x and y .\n                Figure 4 displays the emergence of a Turing stripe pattern in such a syncytial system. Since the Jacobian elements a and d derived above are proportional to k\n                           2\n                   and \\( \\gamma \\) — m, respectively, and since both are diminishing in concert in the proposed model, a or d will not outgrow each other in Eq. (14).

This diffusion may be much slower than free protein diffusion in the cytoplasm. However, in the related model (with MinE protein binding to membranes [55]), spatial wave lengths were found experimentally in the order of 50–70<U+2009>µm. This is of the same order of magnitude as stripe separation in Drosophila, see also the discussion on Fig. 5.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Transition from oscillator-growth to reaction-diffusion pattern formation. a standard oscillation-growth scenario, as seen in Fig. 1. b embryo parameters are changed and the oscillator-growth system is on the border of a transition to a reaction-diffusion based pattern-forming system in the mature (upper, right) part. c parameter transition is complete. The mature part of the embryo now forms a repetitive pattern by a R-D mechanism, but forcing from the oscillator in the posterior growth zone yields the same pattern as before the transition. Thus, the “mutant” embryo may survive this transition to another pattern-forming mechanism, which may then be exploited by evolution as a basis for a simultaneous all-or-none stripe mechanism. Reproduced from [58]\n                      \n                For a specific parameter set, a spectrum of different \\( \\kappa \\)’s is present. If Turing structures form from a (nearly) homogeneous state, the emerging pattern has a wave length close to <U+03BB>\n                           T\n                  <U+2009>=<U+2009>2p/<U+03BA>\n                           T\n                  , see Eq. (18). However, if at the outset the homogeneous state is biased towards a certain wave length within this spectrum, this pattern may be the fastest growing mode. In Fig. 5, the transition from a time oscillator mechanism to a Turing mechanism by the change of a single parameter initially yields a spatial pattern with wave length determined by the oscillator-growth scenario. At the transition to the new pattern forming mechanism, this spatial pattern biases the Turing mechanism to grow with the same wave length, provided it is included in the Turing spectrum. One may note that the Turing wave length (which is roughly in the middle of the spectrum) yields \\( \\lambda \\)\n                           T\\( \\alpha \\) 1(\\( \\gamma \\) — m)1/2. This change is of the same form as the period for the time period T\n                           p\n                   in the oscillating-growth scenario and thus may be about an order of magnitude. During this change, the Turing system may be activated on the segment length induced by the posterior forcing oscillator outside the PSM (for a further discussion, see [58]).\n              Experimental evidence of stripe formation\n                As discussed before, the ten-m RNA is expressed uniformly at the cellular blastoderm stage [41], but as soon as cellularization is finished and gastrulation commences, seven evenly-spaced stripes emerge. To monitor the formation of the stripes, we stained Drosophila embryos with anti-Ten-m antibodies and monitored the evolution of the stripes (Fig. 6). As an internal reference gene, we used the Fushi-tarazu (Ftz) protein. At the time when cellularization is completed, i.e. when each nucleus is encapsulated by a membrane, the first occurrence of a periodic Ten-m pattern was observed (Fig. 6a, g) where the protein was located at the basal as well at the apical surface of the blastoderm cells. Notably, the basal side only showed the emergence of the stripes (Fig. 6g), while the apical side showed uniform staining. In contrast to Ten-m, the stripe of the nuclear Ftz protein were already fully established at cellular blastoderm (Fig. 6b, c). About 30 min later, i.e. during gastrulation, where parts of the future mesoderm cells on the ventral side migrated to the interior of the embryos, Ten-m protein was accumulated in seven stripes at the basal side of the two cells layers, ectoderm and mesoderm (Fig. 6d, h) suggesting that homophilic adhesion of Ten-m between mesoderm and ectoderm cells occurred in a striped fashion. Since Ten-m was not found in stripes on the apical side, it follows that the formation of the stripes must be controlled at the cellular level, and only the basal part was involved in the proposed mechanism of periodic stripe formation. Of note is the fact that the ten-m RNA was still expressed uniformly at this stage [41]. In contrast to Ten-m, the Ftz protein was expressed in nuclei in the entity of the two cell layers (Fig. 6e, f), and did not show any distinct pattern between the ectoderm and the mesoderm.\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        Formation of the Ten-m stripes at gastrulation. a-c confocal picture of a cellularized Drosophila embryo, anterior is to the left and dorsal side up. a Ten-m staining, the protein is detected at the basal (b) as well as apical (a) surface with stronger staining at the basal side where some presumptive stripes emerge, indicated by yellow colors, better seen in a magnification in (g). b identical embryo as in (a), stained for Ftz.

The complexity of the last common ancestor to protostomes and deuterostomes is also a matter of much controversy [65, 66], as is the role of segmentation [67–69]. A segmented common ancestor implies either substantial gene loss, or at least loss of function, notably in unsegmented protostomes [70, 71]. The case for a common segmented ancestor has been reviewed in [6].\n                However, most biologists consider the high degree of similarity of many processes to be the result of independent recruitment of an ancient toolkit, rather than favoring a complex ancestor [72–74]. The principle of the segmentation clock may even be conserved across the animal and plant kingdoms, and thus comprises a universal design principle (rather than a common ancestor), as argued by [75].\n                Several cell-cell interaction genes are very ancient, like those of the Notch, wnt, TGF and hedgehog pathways [65]. The proposed Ten-m oscillator may have originated from proteins forming a cell-cell interaction system already in sponges. Indeed, a tenascin-like protein is found in Homoscleromorphs in the context of formation of basement membranes [76], which may constitute a key step in the evolution of true epithelia [60]. Precursors of the ten-m gene have been found in choanoflagellates [77]. Thus the Notch, wnt, TGF and hedgehog pathways together with ten-m family may have been ancient cell-cell interaction systems, and linking such pathways with receptor tyrosine kinase-based control of transcription factor function may have been an important innovation [59].\n                Cross-talk among cell-cell communication systems also occurs between the Notch, wnt and zic pathways [78] during neural development, which suggests that the Ten-m, Opa/Zic interaction could be a redundant communication system, functioning in parallel with Notch and/or Wnt. This opens the possibility for the key suggestion that the ten-m, opa/zic system may have replaced Notch as a cell-cell synchronization system early during evolution of arthropod segmentation.\n                To realize such transitions, another scenario for evolution of the syncytial stripes in Drosophila from a cellular system, based on an oscillator coupled to a bistable switch may be envisioned, as discussed in [58]. In such a model system, it was shown that the synchronization due to cell-cell interactions, here at the ectoderm-mesoderm interphase (Fig. 6) may give rise to different signaling rates of the components in the oscillator. This in turn may set up a spontaneous pattern-forming mechanism, which at first is forced to yield the same spatial pattern (same segment size) as with the former mechanism, based on the slow-down of the oscillator (Fig. 5). Thus, a simple parameter change in the control system may create such a transition between two, in principle different pattern-forming mechanisms, without inducing lethal effects on the embryo. Once the transition was made, this alternative control system could be exploited, and Drosophila may embody this: the Ten-m oscillator, based on binding to cell membranes, would still function in a syncytium with nuclei close to the outer membrane. The transition to a spontaneous pattern-forming mechanism is easily achieved in this system. Indeed, the cooperative binding of Ten-m to the membrane is capable of generating just such a system, as discussed (Fig. 4). This is in accordance with the appearance of the rather ubiquitous expression pattern of the ten-m mRNA, but striped localization of the corresponding protein, which indicates that the promoter of ten-m is not governed by striped transcription factors. The loss of Ten-m stripes in ftz mutants may be due to interactions of Ftz with the kinetics of Ten-m membrane-bound cleavage, through competition with receptor tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation has been found to accompany the cellularization process in space and time (during the formation of the outgrowing membrane) and underlines its importance during the process [79]. The very long nuclear cycle 14 and the gastrulation phase during which stripes form may also reflect a need for the large Ten-m protein to be synthesized. Indeed, ten-m can only be transcribed during the long nuclear cycle 14 and later stages [41]. All other nuclear cycles are by far too short, and started transcripts will be aborted [41].\n                The role of the equidistant Ten-m protein stripes in Drosophila is unknown, as is the precise role of ten-m in arthropod segmentation. In Tribolium, strong knock-down of Tc-opa or Tc-Ten-m transcripts caused high levels of embryonic lethality, but no overt pair-rule phenotype was observed [80].\n                The above described transition including a fundamental role for ten-m may then have acted as a scaffold on top of which alignment to other pair-rule genes and gap genes may have evolved. Thus, it represents a system which eventually may have developed into the complex hierarchy established for Drosophila. A plethora of genes are essential for the final control system. However, it is highly unlikely that this system emerged simultaneously, and so the question is: How did this intricate system evolve from an apparently different kind of system based on sequential segment formation? Thus, it is conceivable that a only minor part of the entire system is the part responsible for this evolutionary transition.\n              ConclusionsThe ten-m, opa/zic control pair may have evolved early. As the membrane-bound Ten-m participates in cell-cell communication, and as its interactions with the opa/zic promoter may resemble that of the Notch system, it may have been intertwined with the Notch, wnt and FGF pathways in a putative ancient oscillator-growth mechanism for generation of metameric structures [6]. The dynamics of Ten-m binding to membranes may result in oscillations, and we have shown that the model may be extended to comprise a substantial increase in the period of oscillations, as seen in gene-expression waves recorded for vertebrate segmentation.While there is much plasticity in the top layers of the hierarchy established for Drosophila, if the components are investigated for other insects, the segment- polarity genes en, and wg are part of a module with much more conserved properties. Equidistant Ten-m protein stripes emerge in Drosophila close to this module. It is noteworthy that these stripes are not under transcriptional control, as the mRNA is ubiquitously expressed [41].The oscillator in Ten-m membrane binding may develop into a syncytial all-or-none spatial stripe generator with minor shifts in the model parameters. The stripe spacing is retained during this transition. The above transition may provide a scaffold, with equally spaced stripes, on top of which the intricate hierarchy with specific stripe cues, established for Drosophila, may have evolved. The role of this original scaffold in Drosophila segmentation is not clear, as the role of equidistant Ten-m protein stripes in Drosophila is unknown, but at least remnants of the scaffold are still present. This indicates that the role of ten-m in arthropod segmentation may be substantially more profound than hitherto realized.Supplement text\n                Only few studies exist on the role of ten-m in other arthropods. We suggest that ten-m and the conserved module of the segment-polarity genes such as wg and en are better starting points for understanding arthropod segmentation than the top-down approach based on the Drosophila hierarchical components. Here, additional arguments from this new viewpoint are presented that may be of interest to experimentalists working on segmentation.\n              Gap gene cues\n                Gap gene interactions and cue establishment have been successfully simulated for quite some time, reviewed in [11, 81], but outside Drosophila similar studies are much more recent [82]. Gap genes are expressed early in the control of segmentation of short germ-band insects and control some pair-rule genes, but not necessarily in the domain where the particular gap gene is expressed [4]. A renaming of gap genes to ‘cardinal genes’ has thus been suggested [83]. The interactions of the gap genes in Drosophila are quite different to those recorded in the intermediate germband insect (hemipteran) Oncopeltus fasciatus [84]. The role of gap gene to mediate cues for defining stripes seem to be an evolutionary late acquisition of dipterans. Such cues are present in Tribolium, but they show no relation to Drosophila cues [85], and the known number of gap genes does not seem sufficient to specify all the presumptive necessary cues [33]. In a much closer relative to Drosophila, the malaria mosquito Anopheles, the position of some gap genes are inverted with respect to each other, hence, presumptive cues have undergone substantial evolution even within dipterans [86]. A similar result is found in a study of another basal dipteran, the moth midge Clogmia albipunctata, where it appears that stripes of eve in the posterior part of the embryo are not under control of the gap-cues recorded in Drosophila [82].\n              Control of secondary pair-rule genes\n                In this section, we review a number of reports on the control of secondary pair-rule genes in arthropods. Some reports have doubted the top-down model developed for Drosophila with the essential stripe formation mediated from the primary pair-rule genes to the secondary pair-rule genes, reviewed in [10].\n                \n                           prd belongs to the PAX group of genes and pax3/7 plays a role in neurogenesis, segmentation and appendage formation, acquired at the root or prior to the arthropod lineage [38, 87, 88]. Gene expression patterns in spiders are compatible with the presence of gene expression waves, and thus to oscillatory expression. A link between pax3 and zic with wnt during neural crest determination has also been demonstrated in vertebrates [89]. pax genes may predate the origin of nerve and sensory cells [90, 91].\n                \n                           sloppy-paired belongs to the equally ancient fork-head gene family, and sloppy- paired is inferred to be crucial in the en, wg border module, as studied in Drosophila [92, 93].\n                The intricate relation between secondary pair-rule genes themselves is still a matter of substantial discussion [94]. Indeed, it appears that the regulatory interactions of pair-rule genes are different in the beetle Tribolium, with eve, runt and odd as a three-component module regulating each another, as well as regulating downstream targets such as prd and slp [95]. Interestingly, hairy is not a major player in this regulation. This result was confirmed by [96], where considerable divergence of hairy function between Tribolium and Drosophila was reported.\n                The role of secondary pair-rule genes in lower arthropods was illuminated by the study of odd, opa, sip and pairberry in the spider Cupiennius salei [97]. Stripes were reported to move from the posterior growth zone toward the anterior, compatible with an oscillator mechanism. Furthermore, hairy and pairberry (Pax III) started posteriorly and moved all the way to the anterior and eve and runt were recorded in stripes posteriorly, but were not present anteriorly, while odd, opa and sip were expressed only in the anterior part.\n                The importance of the regulation of other primary pair-rule genes by hairy was questioned [98]. It came as a surprise that Hairy was not found to bind other pair-rule promoters than that of prd [98], however, it was suggested that prd may be a good candidate for mediating hairy’s role on segmentation. prd itself had a profound effect on the single promoter element for all-or-none late eve stripes [99]. Such a control module may have had an important early role in the evolution of arthropod segmentation.\n                The elements that generate the expression pattern of a gene were traditionally studied using reporter constructs in transgenic animals. However, this experimental approach has its limits; often, enhancer elements do not faithfully recapitulate native expression patterns. The recorded multiple layers of complexity in cis-regulatory regions of developmental genes may indicate, that the usual approach, where regulatory elements are studied in isolation may be up for revision. An early report of disperse versus compact control elements appeared in [100], a comprehensive review is given in [101]. These reports indicate that the original hierarchy paradigm with striped input from hairy and other primary pair-rule genes may need to be modified, as studies on the secondary pair-rule genes indicated that these genes regulate the primary pair-rule genes as well [10].\n                Recently, some progress was also made by using in silico models simulating the evolution of patterning during development that can be used to investigate the forces and constraints that helped shape these two developmental modes [102]. Analyses were done on a series of earlier simulation studies, thereby exploiting the similarities and differences in their outcomes in relation to model characteristics. Subsequently, these were used to investigate the circumstances and constraints that were important for the evolution of sequential and simultaneous segmentation modes. The report in [102] suggested that constraints arising from the growth process and spatial patterning signal (in this case posterior elongation producing a propagating wave front versus a tissue-wide morphogen gradient) and the evolutionary history (here referred to as ancestral versus derived segmentation mode) strongly shaped the two segmentation mechanisms.\n              The last common ancestor of bilaterians\n                Originally, Hox and ParaHox genes were believed to be responsible for the emergence of patterning of the A-P axis [103]. However, many wnt genes were discovered in sponges, and wnt genes (expressed in association with the oral or animal pole) may have provided the initial evolution of A-P axis organization [104, 105]. It was argued that A-P and D-V patterning mechanisms, and a number of gastrulation genes (including beta-catenin, brachyury, snail, twist, decapentaplegic, bmp and fork-head were in place at least before the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians [104, 105].\n                Key genes involved in early embryo segmentation are also involved in segmentation of the neuronal network. Organization in segmental neuromeres may have been the main ancestral role. Neurons target other neurons or muscle cells and in the search for such a target, guidance molecules are used. Some typical guidance molecules are cell-adhesion or cell-cell communication molecules similar to those needed for morphogenesis, and they may have been recruited to this at a later time point [106].\n                Neurons seem to have arisen at the root of sponges and cnidarians [107–109]. Segmentation in the form of axial growth coupled to an oscillator may have arisen as early as these systems. The much studied Notch signaling system may have been recruited to this process. The interaction of NICD (the intracellular small part of Notch) with Suppressor of hairless (Su(H)) to derepress hairy may be such a common regulatory linkage, preserved from a deep ancestor before cnidarian/bilaterian divergence, perhaps as early as 600–700 Ma ago [110, 111].\n                As far as the role of the much less studied cell-cell communication system based on ten-m is concerned, neuronal protein expression of teneurins (the vertebrate homologs of ten-m) was shown to be conserved from vertebrates to flies [112]. This implies a fundamental role during neurogenesis [112] and neuronal pathfinding [43]. The Ten-m interaction with Opa/Zic repression is involved in both Hydra and vertebrates. This is a further indication that neural development evolved only once [113].\n                Finally, in a theoretical study, it was shown that a few cell-cell interacting genes and signaling proteins suffice to create a fair number of spatial patterns, but a small increase results in a complexity threshold generating very many possibilities [114].\n              Vertebrate-like models for arthropods\n                Attempts to search for basic control elements which are less sensitive to cues, but closer to the en, wg, hh module and in analogy with the oscillator-growth model, were not successful so far. A simple ancient bistable switch may be embedded in the interactions of the secondary pair-rule genes [14]. Several mutually repressive gene pairs are present in this module (i.e. eve, odd and slp mutual repression, or that of odd and prd). The finding of mutual inhibition between sip and en may be important for its role in such a simple ancient switch [93, 115]. In line with a possible original role of segmentation in a primitive nervous system, it was found that the role of en during neurogenesis is very ancient, possibly for the regulation of connectivity of neurons by control of cell adhesion molecules [116]. Thus, the basic mechanism of an oscillator coupled to a bistable switch may be a recurrent theme in arthropod segmentation [25], but redundant systems of cell-cell interactions (i.e. where ten-m replaced Notch) and varying degrees of overlapping bistable modules may be at play.\n              Transition from oscillator-growth to all-or-none stripe formation\n                In [117], it was argued that anterior spider segments were specified almost simultaneously from a pre-existing field of cells, whereas a vertebrate-like mechanism involving wnt8 and Notch/Delta signaling was used to pattern posterior segments. Also in centipedes, the first five anterior segments were formed almost simultaneously [118], whereas the next 35 plus segments formed sequentially. This supported the hypothesis that short-germ arthropods employ two distinct mechanisms to segment their anterior and posterior body parts. Another hypothesis was based on a study of anterior and posterior segmentation in the intermediate germband insect, Oncopeltus fasciatus [119]. Thus, it was suggested that simultaneous specification of all segments as seen in long germband insects such as Drosophila might be due to an expansion of the anterior specification mechanism to the posterior part of the embryo.\n              MethodsCanton-S embryos were collected, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, dechorionated and devitellinized as described [41]. Embryos were stained with rabbit-anti-Ftz antibodies at 1:300 and mab 113 against Ten-m [41] at 1:250 as described [120]. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa 488 nm (Ftz) and Alexa 555 nm (Ten-m) fluorochromes, respectively, as described [120].DeclarationsAcknowledgementsFigures 1 and 5 were reproduced from a previous work [56] with one of the present authors (AH) as co-author.

In the current study, the genetic variabilities present in Kala bhat were estimated using SSR markers and its variability was compared with other improved soybean varieties cultivated in Uttarakhand state, India.\n              \n                Results\n                Seventy-five genotypes cultivated in different districts of Uttarakhand were collected, and molecular analysis was done using 21 SSR markers. A total of 60 alleles were amplified with an average of 2.85 alleles per locus. The mean value of gene diversity and PIC was estimated to be 0.43 and 0.36, respectively. The unrooted phylogenetic tree grouped soybean genotypes into three major clusters, where, yellow seed coat (improved varieties) genotypes were grouped in one cluster, while reddish brown (improved varieties) and Kala bhat showed intermixing. Population structure divided the soybean genotypes into six different populations. AMOVA analysis showed 12% variance among the population, 66% variance among individual and 22% variance was observed within individuals. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) also showed that yellow seed coat genotypes were grouped in one cluster, whereas, the Kala bhat showed scattered distribution and few genotypes of Kala bhat showed grouping with red and yellow genotypes.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The different genetic diversity parameters used in the present study indicate that Kala bhat genotypes were more diverse than the yellow seed coat and brown seed coat colour genotypes. Therefore, Kala bhat genotypes can be a good source for the soybean breeding programme due to its better genetic diversity as well as its medicinal properties.\n              KeywordsSoybeanGenetic diversitySSR markersSeed colourBackgroundSoybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) is an important legume crop which contains 37–42% protein, 17–24% oil and 35% carbohydrates [1], that served as an excellent source of oil and protein for human consumption and animal feed. The wild and cultivated soybeans showed significant phenotypic diversity but the small reproductive difference, and they have very similar genomes in both its size and content [2]. Soybean is grown under varied climatic conditions and geographical locations in India. It occupies an area of 10.8 million hectare and accounting to a production of 11.5 million tone with the productivity of 1065 kg/ha [3]. A potential source of protein and oil makes soybeans a large share in human nutrition, and also improves soil fertility therefore; soybean is also an important crop for research [4].In soybean, evaluation of genetic diversity is enhanced by the use of DNA markers. Researchers have studied the genetic divergence among soybean genotypes for various agronomic traits [5–8] with molecular markers [9–11]. Among different DNA markers, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been extensively used in soybean, each with its own advantages and limitations [12–17].Black seed coat soybean, locally known by different names such as Bhat, Bhatmash and Kala bhat is grown in Kumaon and Garhwal region and in frontiers of Uttarakhand state [18]. In Uttarakhand, these soybean varieties are commonly known as Kala Bhat. It is believed that soybean was introduced by traders via Myanmar from Indonesia. As a result, it has been traditionally grown on a small scale in states like Himachal Pradesh, Kumaon and Garhwal hills of Uttarakhand, East Bengal, Khasi hills and small parts of central India. Kala bhat is also considered as the treasure trove of different medicinal properties. Kala bhat and its products are the richest sources of iso-flavones. Kala bhat, in Uttarakhand is grown in 5734 ha area, with a production and productivity is 5636 tonne and 9.82 q/ha, respectively (Anonymous, 2011). A traditional cultivar of Kala bhat is much low yielder than normal soybean varieties hence this can be improved further by crossing with diverse exotic as well as indigenous germplasm. Morphological characterization of 21 soybean cultivars was done by Oda et al. [19] and 24 Kala bhat genotypes was done by Bhartiya et al. [20].Analyses of the genetic variation and population structure of Kala bhat genotypes are important for their effective conservation and utilization of the valuable genetic resource. The present study was done to estimate the genetic variability and population structure present in Kala bhat cultivated in Uttarakhand state using SSR markers, as the information on the level of diversity present in local landraces (Kala bhat) and population structure had not been studied systematically. The genetic diversity of Kala bhat was also compared with other improved soybean varieties cultivated in Uttarakhand.MethodsCollection of plant materials\n                Seeds of 75 soybean genotypes were procured from NBPGR regional station located at Bhowali, Uttarakhand, India. The Seeds were sown in pots under controlled conditions inside the Green house of NBPGR, New Delhi. Black seed coat genotypes were the landraces (Kala bhat) whereas, reddish-brown and yellowish-white genotypes were improved varieties, which were introduced earlier and naturalized as the population in that agro-ecological region. The leaf samples were collected at 3–4 leaves stage for DNA isolation. The details of each genotype along with passport data, National ID, i.e. Indigenous Collection (IC) number, cultivar name, seed colour, district, region and state are given in Table 1.Table 1\n                        List of Soybean genotypes used in the study with their cultivar name, IC numbers, seed coat colour, district, region and state\n                      S.

The DNA quality was first checked on 0.8% agarose gel and then quantified using Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher, USA). A working concentration of 10 ng/µl DNA stock was prepared for all the 75 soybean genotypes and stored at 4 °C.\n              Genotyping of soybean genotypes using SSR markers\n                Total 51 SSR markers were selected for initial screening. Gradient PCR was done for each primer with selected soybean samples to standardize the temperature for amplification (Ta). 21 SSR primers (Table 2) out of 51 showed good amplification and were considered for further study.

Amplification was performed in a thermocycler (G Storm, UK) using following program; Initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 36 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, Ta for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified products were analyzed on 4% metaphor agarose gel for 4 h at a constant supply of 120 V. Gel pictures were recorded using gel documentation System (Alpha Imager®, USA).\n              Statistical analysis\n                SSR bands generated near expected product size were scored visually for all 75 genotypes of Soybean. The band size of amplified products was determined by comparing with 100 bp DNA ladder (Fermentas, Life Sciences, USA). The SSR bands scored in soybean genotypes was subjected to statistical analysis. Major allele frequency, gene diversity, heterozygosity and polymorphic information content (PIC) for each locus for SSR markers were calculated using Power Marker 3.25 [22]. In addition, genetic distances across the soybean genotypes were calculated using Power Marker 3.25, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed and viewed in Mega version 6 [23] . Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) were performed using software GenAlEx V6.5 [24]. The model-based program, STRUCTURE 2.3.3 [25] was used to infer the population structure. For each K, three replications were run. Each run was implemented over a burn-in period of 100,000 steps with 100,000 Monte Carlo Markov Chain replicates. The membership of each genotype was run for a range of genetic clusters from the value of K<U+2009>=<U+2009>1 to 20 by taking admixture model and correlated allele frequency into account. LnPD derived for each K was then plotted to find the plateau of the <U+0394>K values [26]. The “Structure harvester” program was used (http: //taylor0. biology.ucla.edu) to determine the final population. Venn diagram analysis was performed to identify common accessions between cluster and population using software Venny 2.1 [27].\n              ResultsTotal 21 SSR primers were used for genetic diversity study of 75 soybean genotypes. A total of 60 alleles were amplified with an average of 2.85 alleles per locus. The number of alleles amplified per SSR primer varied from 2 to 4 (Table 2) and maximum numbers of alleles were amplified with primer Sat180, Sat600, Sat554 and Sat478 (four alleles). Gene diversity varied from 0.72 (Satt 180) to 0.11 (Satt 389 and Satt 285) with a mean value of 0.43. The heterozygosity ranged from 0.00 (Satt385, Satt415, Satt277, Satt183, Satt247, Satt584) to 0.98 (Satt 306). Major allele frequency was lowest for Satt180 (0.35) and maximum for Satt389 and Satt285 (0.94). The maximum PIC was observed for primer Satt 180 (0.66) and the minimum was observed for Satt285 and Satt389 (0.10) with a mean value of 0.36. (Table 2).Hierarchical cluster analysis\n                Soybean genotypes were grouped into three major clusters (Fig. 1). Kala bhat got distributed in all the three clusters whereas, brown seed coat colour soybean got grouped only into cluster3 that was mainly dominated by Kala bhat, which shows that there is mixing up of the genetic background between them. However yellow seeded soybeans were grouped into only cluster1 but five genotypes (IC316142, IC430009, IC316172, IC316192 and IC317660) of Kala bhat also grouped with yellow seed coat colour genotypes in cluster1. This hierarchical cluster analysis showed that Kala bhat is sharing genetic similarity with both, yellow and brown seed coat colour soybean, but, there is no sharing of genetic similarity between brown and yellow seed coat colour soybeans.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        NJ tree of 75 soybean genotypes based on SSR markers\n                      \n              Population structure\n                The 75 soybean genotypes got distributed into six populations (Figs. 2 and 3). Seven pure and five admix individuals were present in population1; twelve pure and eight admix individuals were in population 2; five pure and seven admix individuals in population 3; eight pure and four admix individuals in population 4, 10 pure and three admix individuals in population 5, and three pure and three admix individuals in population 6. Mean Fst value for pop1, pop2, pop3, pop4, pop5 and pop6 were 0.464, 0.498, 0.332, 0.608, 0.345, and 0.688 respectively with a mean alpha value of 0.058. The allele frequency divergence among populations is given in Table 3. Average distances (expected heterozygosity) between individuals in the same cluster were between the range of 0.148 for cluster 6 and 0.378 for cluster 5. Population 1, 2 and 3 were dominated by Kala bhat and brown seed coat colour genotypes (highlighted with brown box) got distributed in all the three populations (Fig. 2) while, population 4, 5 and 6 were dominated by yellow seed coat colour genotypes (Fig. 2). Population structure based grouping supports the hierarchical cluster analysis and genotypes grouped in cluster1 corresponds to pop4,5 and 6 while genotypes grouped in cluster3 corresponds to pop1, 2 and 3.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Population structure of 75 soybean genotypes based on SSR markers\n                      \n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Estimation of population using LnP(D) derived <U+0394>k for k from 1 to20\n                      Table 3\n                        Allele-frequency divergence among populations computed using estimates of P (Model based approach)\n                       POP1POP2POP3POP4POP5POP6POP1-0.19440.17810.24480.16340.1877POP20.1944-0.16090.29320.30360.2782POP30.17810.1609-0.18920.20290.2013POP40.24480.29320.1892-0.21970.1772POP50.16340.30360.20290.2197-0.2044POP60.18770.27820.20130.17720.2044-\n              Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA)\n                Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of soybean genotypes based on seed coat color was performed to analyze the distribution of genetic diversity between and within the populations. AMOVA analysis showed 12% diversity among populations, 22% diversity within individuals and a maximum of 66% diversity among individuals (Table 4).Table 4\n                        Summary of AMOVA for three soybean populations\n                      SourcedfSSMSEst.

The brown seed coat colour soybean got distributed in both the groups. The yellow seed coat colour soybean was confined to one group, a similar pattern was also observed during the cluster analysis. The first three axes of PCoA have explained a cumulative percent variation of 33.15% (Fig. 4). This shows large diversity exists in the genotypes studied.\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of 75 soybean genotypes (Populations based on seed coat colour)\n                      \n              Co-linearity between hierarchical cluster and model based population analysis\n                Since the similar pattern of a grouping of genotypes was observed in the hierarchical cluster as well as in population structure, therefore, the Co-linearity between a grouping of genotypes in hierarchical cluster and model based population structure was confirmed using Venn diagram (Fig. 5a and b). The Venn diagram (Fig. 5a) showed that, out of 32 genotypes tested; 30 genotypes were common between population 4, 5, 6 and cluster 1 (93.8%) similarly, Venn diagram (Fig. 5b) showed that 41 genotypes were common between population 1, 2, 3 and cluster 3 (91.1%). This study supports that grouping of soybean genotypes based on the hierarchical cluster and model based approaches were more than 90% similar.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        \n                                       a Venn diagram showing co linearity between cluster 1 and pop4, 5, 5 b Venn diagram showing co linearity between cluster 3 and pop1, 2, 3\n                      \n              DiscussionThe assessment of genetic diversity is not only important for crop improvement but also important for the efficient management and protection of the available genetic resource. The reliable and authentic results of molecular profiling have made it preferred in genetic diversity study. The molecular study is less influenced by environmental fluctuations, stands another reason for its preference in breeding [28]. Also, it is less biased when compared with estimates obtained by the coefficient of parentage and phenotypic characters [19]. Genetic diversity study has several aspects, first, to identify distinct genetic groups for the retention of germplasm [29], second, to identify genes that correspond to important phenotypic traits and genetic shifts during domestication approach, third, is to find the aspects of history and timing of domestication.The SSR primers used in the present study amplified an average number of 2.61 alleles per locus with a gene diversity value of 0.43. Li et al. [30] reported 19.7 alleles per locus with gene diversity value of 0.72 during characterization of 1863 Chinese soybean landraces with 59 SSR markers. Similarly, Guan et al. [31] reported 16.2 alleles per locus with a gene diversity of 0.84 while comparing the genetic diversity of 205 Chinese landraces and also Liu et al. [32] reported 7.14 alleles per locus in his study on 91 Shaanxi soybean landraces. These reports show a higher number of alleles per locus in comparison to present study. Doldi et al. [33] reported two to six alleles per locus during characterization of 18 soybean cultivars using 12 microsatellite primers and Tantasawat et al. [34] reported 4.82 alleles per locus. Therefore, allelic richness (average number of alleles per locus) is an effective index for diversity evaluation but it is largely dependent on the sample size [35]. Hence to improve the allelic richness more landraces needs to be introduced into the system thus, enhancing genetic diversity. The mean PIC value obtained in the present study was 0.36, where sat180, sat600, sat554 and sat478 are having 4 alleles per locus and PIC value between 0.55-0.66. These markers with high PIC values become informative for distinguishing among the soybean genotypes. Similar values have been reported by Zhang et al. [36] (0.38), Hisano et al. [37] (0.40), Wang et al. [35] (0.50) and Kim et al. [38] (0.87) with good genetic diversity in their set of samples. As a self -fertilizing crop soybean is expected to have low heterozygosity than hybrid crops [36], here we got low heterozygosity (0.11) much lower than the value reported by Zhang et al. [36] (0.46). Li et al. [30] reported heterozygosity of 0.014 in grain soybean whereas, 0.069 and 0.446 were reported in wild soybean by Liu et al.[39] and Wang et al. [40] respectively. Gene diversity observed in the present study was 0.43; this low level of gene diversity may be ascribed to the emphasis on direct introductions from introduced germplasm and single cross hybrids in the soybean breeding programs. Therefore, diverse germplasm needs to be introduced for more genetic variability [41] Narvel et. al. [14] analyzed 79 elite soybean cultivars with 74 SSR markers showing a low value of gene diversity. Gene diversity reported by Li et al. [42] Wang et al. [43] and Hudcovicova and Kraic [44] showed a substantially higher -value i.e. 0.77, 0.80 and 0.71 respectively on different sets of soybean genotypes. Hierarchical clustering divided the soybean landraces into three distinct clusters, and yellow seed coat colour soybean got grouped into one cluster. In this study, seed coat colour based grouping was more logical than grouping based on geographical location. The analysis based on geographical location showed mixing of genotypes from one location to another location and indicated frequent seed exchange across the geographical location. But when cluster analysis was done based on seed coat colour, the yellow seed coat colour genotypes were grouped together except one genotype(IC-469881). This shows that yellow seed coat colour genotypes are a recent introduction into this area, and breeders have not utilized yellow seed colour genotypes in the breeding programs. Tantasawat et al. [34] reported four major clusters in 25 soybean genotypes analysed by 11 SSR markers. Wang et al. [40] obtained two groups with five wild soybean population assessed by ten SSR markers and Wen et al. [45] also reported two clusters while studying the evolutionary relationship among ecotypes of Glycine max and G. soja in China. Ghosh et al. [46] reported two clusters and six sub clusters while studying 32 soybean cultivars with 10 SSR markers. Hirota et al. [47] studied black soybean landraces of Tanba region and got two distinct clusters, where as three clusters were obtained by Kondetti et al. [48] while studying 55 Indian Soybean varieties. Population structure divided the soybean genotypes into six different populations. Qiu et al. [49] reported three populations as wild, semi wild and cultivated soybean from Yangstee region whereas; two populations were obtained by Chung et al. [50] in Korean wild and cultivated accessions of soybean and Gyu-Taek Cho et al. [51] reported three populations in Korean land races. PCoA analysis also showed consistent results when seen in terms of a grouping of landraces in cluster analysis. AMOVA showed 12% variance between populations, 22% variance within individuals and 66% variance among individuals. Since soybean is a self pollinated crop, therefore, less variation within individual and more variation among varieties/land races are expected. The analysis done by Venn diagrams showed that, more than 90% co-linearity between cluster 3 and pop1, pop2, pop3 and between cluster 1 and pop4, pop5, pop6. This study proves that SSR based genotyping is a better way to study the genetic diversity in soybean because grouping done by the Hierarchical method and population structure method were more than 90% similar.ConclusionsOur study showed that Kala bhat, which has medicinal properties possess large diversity in comparison to yellow and brown seed coat soybean genotypes cultivated in Uttarakhand, India. This study confirms the hypothesis that the landraces are thought to possess rare alleles and therefore, good genetic diversity. This study also provides useful insights about the Kala bhat (black coloured soybean) among different districts of Uttarakhand and simultaneous isolation of yellow coloured soybean. Improving the genetic base requires an introduction of new alleles into the breeding program, and this can only be done by exploiting the genetic variability found in Kala bhat.Abbreviations\n                AMOVA: \n                    Analysis of molecular variance\n                  PCoA: \n                    Principal Coordinate Analysis\n                  PIC: \n                    Polymorphic information content\n                  SSR: \n                    Simple sequence repeats\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe are thankful to the Director, NBPGR, New Delhi, who provided facilities for this work.

Enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction, is no longer necessary for obtaining mitogenomic data. Despite the benefits, shotgun sequencing approaches also have disadvantages. They do not guarantee obtaining the complete mitogenome, generally require larger amounts of input DNA and coverage is low compared to sequencing with enrichment strategies. If the mitogenome could be amplified in a single amplification, additional time and costs for sample preparation might outweigh these disadvantages.\n              \n                Results\n                A sequence of the complete mitochondrial genome of the pupilloid landsnail Orcula dolium is presented. The mitogenome was amplified in a single long-range (LR) PCR and sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies). The length is 14,063 nt and the average depth of coverage is 1112 X. This is the first published mitogenome for a member of the family Orculidae. It has the typical metazoan makeup of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNAs (12S and 16S) and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Orcula is positioned between Pupilla and the Vertiginidae as the sister-group of Gastrocopta and Vertigo, together. An ancestral gene order reconstruction shows that Orthurethra in contrast to other Stylommatophora, have tRNA-H before tRNA-G and that the gene order in the ‘non-achatinoid’ clade is identical to that of closely related non-stylommatophoran taxa.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                We show it is feasible to ultra-deep sequence a mitogenome from a single LR-PCR. This approach is particularly relevant to studies that have low concentrations of input DNA. It results in a more efficient use of NGS capacity (only the targeted fraction is sequenced) and is an effective selection against nuclear mitochondrial inserts (NUMTS). In contrast to previous studies based in particular on 28S, our results indicate that phylogeny reconstructions based on complete mitogenomes might be more suitable to resolve deep relationships within Stylommatophora. Ancestral gene order reconstructions reveal rearrangements that characterize systematic groups.\n              KeywordsStylommatophoraOrthurethraMitochondrial genomeGene arrangementBackgroundA recent increase in the number of sequenced mitogenomes allows for a better understanding of gastropod evolution [1–3]. Of the more than sixty mitogenomes that are currently available for Gastropoda, less than twenty belong to the Eupulmonata sensu [4], of which the clade Stylommatophora represents the majority of the terrestrial snails. Although the first stylommatophoran mitogenome was sequenced nearly two decades ago [5], it took more than 15 years before new mitogenomes were added to this group on about a yearly basis, as is the case at present. Complete mitogenomes have been obtained for 18 species of Stylommatophora now (excluding Euhadra and Orcula; accessed 2016-10-17) (Table 1). These include representatives of the superfamilies Achatinelloidea, Clausilloidea, Helicoidea, Orthalicoidea, Pupilloidea, Succinoidea and Urocoptoidea, or more inclusively the subclades Elasmognatha, Orthurethra, the ‘Limacoid clade’, the informal group Sigmurethra sensu [6] and the ‘achatinoid clade’ sensu [7]. Here we report the mitochondrial genome of a fifth orthurethran species, the first one for the family Orculidae, viz. Orcula dolium (Drapernaud, 1801). It is the type species of the genus Orcula Held 1837, which comprises 13 species featuring ovate–cylindrical shells of 5 to 10 mm height. Of these, O. dolium shows the widest distribution and is ecologically most tolerant. Orcula is common in limestone areas of the Central European Alps and the Western Carpathians and is usually associated with mountainous forest habitats and rocky landscapes. Its altitudinal distribution covers a range from 200 m to 2160 m above sea level [8]. Loess sediments of the Pannonian Basin (Hungary, Republic of Croatia and Republic of Serbia) [9–11] and the periphery of the Western and Eastern Alps [12, 13] show that O. dolium was also widely distributed throughout glacial periods of the Late Pleistocene.Table 1\n                      List of included mitogenomes (accessed 2016-10-17)\n                      SpeciesLength (nt)GenBankReferenceStylommatophora Orthurethra  \n                                          Achatinella mustelina\n                                       16,323KU525108[41]  \n                                          Gastrocopta cristata\n                                       14,060KC185403[42]  \n                                          Orcula dolium\n                                       14,063KJ867421This study  \n                                          Pupilla muscorum\n                                       14,149KC185404[42]  \n                                          Vertigo pusilla\n                                       14,078KC185405[42] Sigmurethra  \n                                          Achatina fulica\n                                       15,057KJ744205[59]  \n                                          Aegista aubryana\n                                       14,238NC_029419[60]  \n                                          Aegista diversifamilia\n                                       14,039KR002567[61]  \n                                          Albinaria caerulea (Deshayes, 1835)14,130NC_001761[5]  \n                                          Camaena cicatricosa\n                                       13,843KM365408[48]  \n                                          Cernuella virgata\n                                       14,147KR736333[62]  \n                                          Cerion incanum\n                                       15,177NC_025645[57]  \n                                          Cepaea nemoralis Linnaeus, 175814,100NC_001816[63]  \n                                          Cornu aspersum (Müller, 1774)14,050NC_021747[35]  \n                                          Cylindrus obtusus (Draparnaud, 1805)14,610NC_017872[47]  \n                                          Dolicheulota formosensis\n                                       14,237KR338956[61]  \n                                          Euhadra herklotsi\n                                       ?Z71693- Z71701[64]  \n                                          Mastigeulota kiangsinensis\n                                       14,029KM083123[65]  \n                                          Naesiotus nux\n                                       15,197KT821554[24] Elasmognatha  \n                                          Succinea putris Linnaeus, 175814,092NC_016190[3]Basommatophora Hygrophila  \n                                          Biomphalaria glabrata\n                                       13,670NC_005439[66]  \n                                          Biomphalaria tenagophila\n                                       13,722NC_010220[67]  \n                                          Galba pervia\n                                       13,768NC_018536[68]  \n                                          Physella acuta\n                                       14,490JQ390525[69]Archaepulmonata Ellobioidea  \n                                          Myosotella myosotis\n                                       14,246NC_012434[70]  \n                                          Pedipes pedipes\n                                       16,708NC_016179[3]Systellomatophora  \n                                          Rhopalocaulis grandidieri\n                                       14,523NC_016183[3]\n                    Despite being incomplete, the mitogenome of E. herklotsi was included because of its relevance to the arrangement of genes within the Helicoidea. The mitogenome of Radix balthica [71] was excluded because it is poorly annotated (GenBank accession number HQ330989) and of low quality [68, 69]\n                  MethodsThis study was carried out on a specimen of Orcula dolium dolium (RMNH 114169) collected in 2009 in SW Berchtesgaden (Bayern, Germany). DNA was extracted with a Qiagen DNA tissue kit. Total yield of DNA extracted was ~13 ug (DNA conc. 66.7 ng/ul with an elution volume of 200 ul). Using universal barcoding primers [14] a partial sequence (655 nt) of Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) was obtained using the procedure described in [15]. This sequence was used to design specimen specific primers (Orcula_529_COI_F 5'-CTAAGACTATTTGTGTGGTCGATCTTA-3' and Orcula_336_COI_R 5'-TCTAGACCTAATCAAAAGAACAAATGAAG-3') to amlify the complete mitogenome of O. dolium. An amplicon with a length of 13,871 nt was obtained with GoTaq long PCR Master Mix (Promega) using the manufacturers protocol. Thermocycling profile was 2 m. at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s. at 94 °C, 15 m. at 65 °C, 10 m. at 72 °C. The PCR product was gel purified with the Wizard SV gel and PCR cleanup-system (Promega) and subsequently checked on a BioAnalyzer 2100 using a DNA 12000 chip (Agilent). The Orcula library was part of a combined run in which different samples were pooled. The purified amplicon was enzymatically digested and individual samples were ligated with a unique Ion Express Barcode Adapter (Life Technologies) using the NEBNext Fast DNA & Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent (New England Biolabs), following the manufacturers instructions. After ligation samples were quantified on the Bioanalyser 2100 using a DNA High sensitivity chip (Agilent). An equimolair pool was prepared of the highest possible concentration. This equimolair pool was diluted according to the calculated template dilution factor to target 10–30% of all positive Ion Sphere Particles. Template preparation and enrichment was carried out with the Ion Touch 2 system, using the OT2 400 kit (Life Technologies), according to the manufactures protocol (7218RevA0). The enriched Ion Sphere Particles were prepared for sequencing on a Personal Genome Machine (PGM) with the Ion PGM 400 Sequencing kit as described in the protocol using a 316v2 chip.Quality check and assembly\n                Reads from the Orcula library were separated from the pool based on their unique barcode tag by the Ion Torrent Server. Quality was checked using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads shorter than 35 nt or with a phred score below 28 were removed with Fastx_trimmer (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). A ‘de novo’ assembly was carried out with Spades v.2.5.1. [16] and reads were mapped against available orthurethran sequences (KC185403-05, KU525108) using Geneious v.7.1.7 [17]. Finally ‘de novo’ contigs larger than 1 kb (for gene order assessment) and mapping assemblies were merged (see Additional file 1: Figure S1) and used as reference for iterative mapping (medium sensitivity, no fine tuning, not trimmed before mapping; other parameters left at default) of the quality checked reads (again using Geneious v.7.1.7). The reason for this two-step approach was that the initial ‘de novo’ assembly did not result in a contig of expected length. To confirm the final assembly (and enclosed gene order) a selection of matching reads (~ten fold downsampling) was analysed with another assembler, MITObim v. 1.8 [18] (using the 655 nt COI sequence as seed bait) and with Spades 2.5.1. [17] again also.\n              Annotation\n                The position of the protein coding genes (PCGs) was determined by alignment with available stylommatophoran mitogenomes (Table 1) and by locating start and stop codons. The identification of the ribosomal RNAs was done with BLAST searches. Arwen and Mitos [19] were used to locate the tRNAs and the secondary structures were all generated with Arwen [20]. The contig sequence was annotated in Geneious [17].\n              Phylogenetic analyses\n                A prerequisite for understanding (mitochondrial) gene rearrangements is a robust, well rooted phylogeny. Representatives of the clades Hygrophila and Eupulmonata were selected as outgroup because these taxa are supposed to be closely related to, but not part of the ingroup [3, 4, 21]. For each of the 13 PCGs alignments were made with TranslatorX [22]; a program that aligns nucleotide sequences based on their corresponding amino acid translations. Translator X was run with the MAFFT alignment module [23] and the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code; other settings were left at default. A supposed ‘copy’ of ND4L [24] for Naesiotus nux (GenBank accession number NC_028553) was excluded because there are no stylommatophoran homologs known to align it with. Ribosomal genes were individually aligned in Geneious, again using MAFFT [23] and conserved datablocks were selected with Gblocks [25] using default settings. The PCG and ribosomal alignments were concatenated in Geneious and exported as a phylip formatted matrix (27 taxa, 13,419 nucleotides). With 41 datablocks specified (each codon position and the ribosomal RNAs), PartitionFinder v.1.1.1 [26] estimated the best partitioning scheme (33 partitions) and nucleotide substitution models. A Bayesian analysis (two simultaneous MCMC runs 10 M generations each) was conducted with MrBayes 3.2.3 hosted on the CIPRES Science Gateway [27]. Inspection of the parameter files with Tracer v.1.5 [28] showed proper mixing of the MCMC (effective sampling size values<U+2009>><U+2009>200). The first 2500 trees (25% of each tree-file) were discarded as burnin. Majority rule consensus trees were visualised and edited in FigTree v.1.4.0 [29]. The procedure was repeated with the amino acid alignments (13 datablocks, 4190 amino acids) from TranslatorX [22]. The estimated partitioning scheme now consisted of six partitions and the analysis was carried out with 2.5 M generations to keep computation time tenable. Nucleotide and amino acid datamatrices were analysed separately to see if both would yield phylogenies with similar topologies. Abbreviations: BPP<U+2009>=<U+2009>Bayesian Posterior Probability.\n              Mitochondrial gene arrangements\n                An ancestral gene order reconstruction [30] was done using the Maximum Likelihood Gene Order analysis (MLGO) web server (http://www.geneorder.org/server.php) using the phylogeny obtained in the previous step (outgroup reduced to Biomphalaria) as a fixed tree (ie. Small Parsimony Problem, using SPP option).\n              Taxonomic implications\n                For the classification and the nomenclature of the various taxa, the review by Bouchet and Rocroi [6] served as the primary starting point. Historic classifications such as the Pilsbry-Baker system [31, 32] are not exhaustively discussed. The more recent literature is dealt with only when it contains additional data. Ever since the rise of phylogenetic systematics, the increase of more detailed anatomical analyses and in particular the quickly growing quantity of molecular data, the classification of the gastropods has been in a confusing transitional state. In the monograph of Zilch [33] for example, published before the rise of phylogenetic systematics had started, the classis Gastropoda is subdivided into the subclasses Prosobranchia and Euthyneura. The latter subclassis contains the ordines Basommatophora and Stylommatophora, whereas the ordo Stylommatophora is further split into the subordines Orthurethra, Heterurethra and Sigmurethra. Many of these names are still in use, but often not for exactly the same group of species. Next to the classical taxonomical categories, new nominal taxa names were more recently introduced, like ‘clade’ and ‘informal group’. Bouchet et al. [6] for example, in a recent nomenclatorial monograph on gastropod classification and nomenclature, use ‘Informal Group Pulmonata’ as a partial synonym of Zilch’s Euthyneura. The Orthurethra are accepted by [6] as a ‘Subclade’, which is identical with Zilch’s subordo of that name. There are many more discrepancies, however. For a more recent contribution to this subject, see [4]. Here we do not aim at a summary of the changing and sometimes conflicting views regarding gastropod phylogeny.\n              ResultsThe Ion-Torrent run resulted in 118,854 reads of which 115,412 were retained after trimming with Fastx_trimmer. The retained reads were in the length range 35–313 nt and had an average length of 143.8 nt (sd. 42.8). Of these 107,569 could be mapped against the merged reference sequence, resulting in an average coverage of 1112X (min. 208X, max. 2483X; see Fig. 1). The mitogenome of O. dolium has a length of 14,063 nucleotides, which is within the known range for Stylommatophora (13.843 and 16.323 nt for Camaena and Achatinella, respectively) and very similar to that reported for other Pupilloidea (14,060 and 14,078 nt for Gastrocopta and Vertigo respectively). Both MITObim v.1.8 [18] and Spades v.2.5.1 [17] yielded the same length and nucleotide sequence using the downsampled dataset. The AT content is 66% and skews for AT and GC are -0.084 and 0.043. All 37 common metazoan genes (13 protein coding genes, two rRNAs and 22 tRNAs) were recovered. The gene order of PCGs and ribosomal RNAs was identical to those of most Stylommatophora (Achatinelloidea and certain Helicoidea excepted). The distribution of tRNAs was, with one mutational step, most similar to that of Vertigo and Albinaria. All tRNAs showed standard cloverleaf secondary structures except for tRNA-K and tRNA-W which had missing T-arms and tRNA-S1 which had a D-arm missing (see Additional file 2: Figure S2). The annotated mitogenome of O. dolium has been deposited in GenBank (accession number KJ867421).\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Coverage plot of the Orcula dolium mitochondrial genome (14,063 nt) and corresponding gene annotation\n                    DiscussionSelection of outgroup\n                Recent studies have shown that the traditionally accepted nominal taxa Pulmonata and Opisthobranchia are not monophyletic, what necessitated a new classification of the Euthyneura [4]. Within that taxon these authors accept Panpulmonata and Eupulmonata, with the Stylommatophora belonging to the Eupulmonata. The Informal Group Basommatophora is assigned to a paraphyletic group Panpulmonata. Next to the selection of markers and taxa, outgroup selection strongly affects our concept of Euthyneuran phylogeny, as is evident from the literature [1, 3, 4, 21, 34–36]. Despite the differences, all these studies show that the clades Hygrophila (Lymnaeoidea & Planorboidea), Systellommatophora (Veronicelloidea) and Eupulmonata (Ellobioidea) are closely related to, but separate from the Stylommatophora (i.e. these are eligible outgroup taxa).\n              Gene order\n                Changes in mitochondrial gene order are common in gastropods [1, 3, 21]. Among the Stylommatophora however, the order is rather conserved (Fig. 2). Here most shifts occur in the arrangement of tRNAs. In the Stylommatophora PCG rearrangements have only been recorded in Helicidae (COIII), Aegista (Bradybaenidae; ND3) and Achatinella (Achatinellidae; COII). Most transpositions have been observed in the Helicoidea, but there is a strong bias in available data for that group.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Mitogenomic gene arrangement of Stylommatophora and Euthyneuran outgroup taxa\n                      \n              Polarisation\n                The monophyly of the Stylommatophora has been shown repeatedly [4, 7, 34, 37] (Fig. 2), but a subdivision into lower taxa remained problematic. Inclusion of additional genes or investigation of rare genomic changes (RGCs), such as changes in mitochondrial gene order [38] has been suggested [39] to solve this problem. Mitochondrial gene order data (Fig. 2) together with the phylogeny (Fig. 3) allowed for a reconstruction of the ancestral gene order (Fig. 4). Rearrangements that characterize established systematic groups are discussed below.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Bayesian mitogenomic phylogeny reconstructions of Stylommatophora based on nucleotide (left) and amino acid data (right)\n                      \n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Ancestral (mt) gene order reconstruction for Stylommatophora\n                      \n              Comparison with existing classifications\n                The number of Stylommatophora with known mitogenomes is still limited, but representatives of most of the major groups are available now. This allows for a preliminary comparison.\n                Orthurethra [31]\n                  Initially, Orthurethra was considered a ‘primitive’ group of Stylommatophora [31, 40]. Molecular analyses showed however, that the Orthurethra are a more derived taxon [7, 37]. Bouchet and Rocroi [6] accept five orthurethran superfamilies, one of which is the Pupilloidea. Complete mitogenomic sequences are available only for Achatinelloidea [41] and for Pupilloidea, i.e. for Pupillidae and Vertiginidae [42] and now additionally for Orculidae.\n                  The Orthurethra and the Pupilloidea are both monophyletic. The Vertiginidae, represented by Gastrocopta and Vertigo are the sister-group of the Orculidae (Fig. 2). Recently, Gastrocopta (Gastrocoptinae) was excluded from the ‘vertiginid’-clade (Vertiginidae), mainly based on 28S sequence data; that phylogeny [43] showed two clades: one consisting of Pupilla and Vertigo and another with Orcula and Gastrocopta, albeit poorly supported. These sister-group relationships, as well as the exclusion of Gastrocoptinae from Vertiginidae are rejected by our data (Fig. 2).\n                  The Clausilioidea, classified in an Informal Group Sigmurethra [6] and the Orthurethra are sister-groups (BPP<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0; Fig. 2).\n                  In the Orthurethra (and Stylommatophora in general) most mitochondrial gene rearrangements occurred in the region between CytB and ATP8. Except for that region, the gene order of Pupilloidea is identical to that in Albinaria (Fig. 2). In the Achatinelloidea a number of rearrangements was found that are not observed in Pupilloidea (most prominent is the transposition of the region tRNA-F_COII_tRNA-YHG; Fig. 2). Both orthurethran superfamilies have the gene order tRNA-HG (or at least tRNA-H before tRNA-G) in which they deviate from other Stylommatophora (which have tRNA-GH). We hypothesize that the arrangement tRNA-HG is an apomorphic character state for the Orthurethra.\n                  The MLGO result predicted tRNA-YHWG as the ancestral gene arrangement for Orthurethra (requiring additional steps for all orthurethrans except Vertigo). Alternatively tRNA-YHGW would have been equally parsimonious (also nine steps) and is more likely, given that tRNA-YHG is observed in Achatinella, Pupilla and Gastrocopta. Therefore the latter scenario was adopted in Fig. 4. In either reconstruction the shift from tRNA-GH to tRNA-H_before_G must have taken place early in orthurethran history. Additionaly, for the Pupilloidea, tRNA-W was transposed independently in Orcula and Vertigo, tRNA-DC in Pupilla, and tRNA-Q from L-strand to H-strand in Gastrocopta (Figs. 2 and 4).\n                           \n                  The mitogenome of Achatinella mustelina is said to be “similar to those of other pulmonates” [41]. We assume that statement refers to gene composition, not gene order, because one of the largest transpositions recorded for Stylommatophora is seen in Achatinella. The latter taxon has transposed tRNA-F_COII_tRNA-YHG (assuming it was not the larger fragement tRNA-WQL2_ATP8-ATP6_tRNA-RE_12S), tRNA-W and tRNA-N (Figs. 2 and 4).\n                Heterurethra [31]\n                  The Heterurethra sensu Pilsbry [31] or the subclade Elasmognatha according to [6] when Athoracophoroidea are included next to Succineoidea, were classified in a clade with Acavoidea (Leucotaenius) and Orthalicoidea (Placostylus) [7, 37], albeit poorly supported. Our analyses support (BPP<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.92/0.97; Fig. 3) a sister-group relation between Elasmognatha (Succinea: Succineoidea) and Orthalicoidea (Naesiotus). In agreement with previous studies [7, 37] our data indicate that Succineoidea and Orthalicoidea together are the sister-group of the combined Urocoptoidea and Helicoidea (Fig. 3). Of the three gene rearrangements within Succinea (Figs. 2 and 4) none is shared with Naesiotus.\n                  A peculiar feature of Naesiotus nux (genbank access.nr. KT821554) is a ‘duplication’ of ND4L (positioned between tRNA-L and tRNA-P; [24]). Since this ‘copy’ (sequence divergence<U+2009>><U+2009>60%) was not present in other Stylommatophora it could not be included in our analyses. It might partly explain the increased size of the mitogenome of N. nux compared to that of other Stylommatophora (Table 1).\n                Mesurethra [32]\n                  Of this nominal taxon the Cerionidae and Clausiliidae, which were included by [44], are represented. Earlier studies showed the polyphyly of this group [7, 37]. Our phylogeny reconstructions (Fig. 3) also reject the hypothesis of a close relation between Cerionidae and Clausiliidae.\n                  Recently, Urocoptidae and Cerionidae were shown to constitute a monophyletic group (based on 28S sequence data) for which the superfamily Urocoptoidea was introduced [45]. Urocoptoidea and Helicoidea (= Sigmurethra) are sister-groups (BPP<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0; Fig. 3). Vaught [46] classified only the Clausiloidea as Mesurethra.\n                Sigmurethra [31]\n                  The Sigmurethra sensu Pilsbry [31] was already shown to be paraphyletic [7, 37]. Our data reconfirm that Sigmurethra is not monophyletic (Fig. 3). Bouchet and Rocroi [6] refer to the this nominal taxon as an ‘Informal Group’, which may remain in use as long as no preferential alternative has been advocated.\n                ‘Achatinoid clade’ [7, 37]\n                  In our analyses, Achatina fulica is the sister-group of the ‘non-Achatinoid’ clade. Stylommatophora (‘Achatinoid’ and ‘non-Achatinoid’ clades) is a monophyletic group (BPP<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0; Fig. 3). The mitogenomic gene arrangement of Achatina differs from that of the other Stylommatophora (Fig. 2), but it is identical to that of the outgroup genera Biomphalaria and Planorbarius, which are classified with the Planorboidea of the clade Hygrophila. Unlike the representatives of the ‘non-Achatinoid clade’, Achatina has the gene order tRNA-LAP (between 16S and ND6), which also occurs in more distantly related outgroups (Pedipes, Myosotella and Rhopalocaulis; Fig. 2). Therefore, using the principle of outgroup comparison, we hypothesize that the ancestral mitochondrial gene order of the Stylommatophora has been identical to the arrangement currently found in Achatina and in some taxa of the clade Hygrophila.\n                ‘Non-Achatinoid clade’ [7, 37]\n                  Our data show a strongly supported (BPP<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.0; Fig. 3) basal split in the ‘non-Achatinoid clade’ with on the one hand Orthurethra (Achatinelloidea, Pupilloidea)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Clausilioidea and on the other hand Elasmognatha (= Heterurethra)<U+2009>+<U+2009>Orthalicoidea<U+2009>+<U+2009>Urocoptoidea<U+2009>+<U+2009>Helicoidea. In the latter clade Elasmognatha<U+2009>+<U+2009>Orthalicoidea is the sister-group of Urocoptoidea<U+2009>+<U+2009>Helicoidea.\n                  Rearrangements of PCGs are thus far only observed in the Helicoidea and Achatinelloidea. Separation of ND6 and ND5 by a tRNA from the L-P-A region and transposition of tRNA-T<U+2009>+<U+2009>COIII might indeed be an apomorphy for the Helicidae, as suggested by [47]; the recently added mitogenome of Cornu aspersum [35] confirms this. We hypothesize that the gene arrangement tRNA-GH before tRNA-YW is an apomorphic character state characterizing Bradybaenidae. The transposition of ND3 is not observed in the other bradybaenids and at the moment being, is unique to Aegista. The mitogenomic gene arrangement of Camaenidae might be in between that of an helicoid ancestor and that of Bradybaenidae; tRNA-Y is still at the ancestral position, whereas tRNA-W is already transposed to the ‘bradybaenid’ location (albeit still on the heavy strand). Wang et al. concluded that the mitogenomic gene order of Camaena cicatricosa differs from that in other stylommatophores in the position of COII and the tRNA’s C, F, D, G, H and W [48]. The single transposition of tRNA-D is a more parsimonious explanation for the first four ‘differences’. The latter three could subsequently be explained by a single transposition of tRNA-W after tRNA-GH or the transposition of tRNA-GH (as a single unit) before tRNA-W. Movement of two consecutive tRNA’s as a single unit is not uncommon, as is exemplified by tRNA-YW in Succinea and tRNA-AP in Cerion (Fig. 2).\n                  Camaenidae and Bradybaenidae have been considered confamilial by Scott [49], whereas both nominal taxa are paraphyletic according to others [7, 50]. According to our analyses, Camaenidae and Bradybaenidae form a clade within the Helicoidea (Fig. 3), leaving no place for a separate superfamily Camaenoidea, which was accepted by [51, 52].\n                  The mitochondrial gene arrangements of Albinaria (Clausilioidea) and Naesiotus (Orthalicoidea) are identical, despite the fact that both taxa belong to different basal groups within the ‘non-Achatinoid’ clade. We hypothesize that this is the ancestral mitogenomic gene order of the ‘non-Achatinoid clade’ and that a rearrangement from tRNA-LAP to tRNA-LPA characterized the most recent common ancestor of this clade.\n                On the chosen sequence strategy\n                Amplification of the complete mitochondrial genome in a single LR-PCR with target specific primers for the snail species tested here was straightforward. Nevertheless, other studies show that full mitogenomic amplifications can be stochastic [53] and the method will not work with degraded material. Alternatively the mitochondrial fraction can be enriched by physical isolation (e.g. centrifugation in CsCl-gradient; requires significant amounts of starting material) or by target capture approaches, in which mitochondrial sequences are isolated by hybridisation to biotinylated probes [54]. Some studies abandon mitochondrial enrichment steps entirely and shotgun sequence (pools of) DNA extracts instead [41, 47, 55–58]. Each of these methods have their own strengths and weaknesses. In studies where multiple extracts are pooled and that do not make use of indexing tags, additional controls are necessary to check against ‘chimeric’ assemblies (especially when closely related taxa are involved). To this end (and for linking the obtained mitogenomes to species or vouchers) multiple ‘bait’ sequences have to be determined a priori [55, 56, 58]. A mitogenome assembled with pooled DNA from a large number of individuals of the same species [41], is inevitably artificial. Enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction by LR-PCR (and labeling using indexing tag sequences) is expensive and potentially time-consuming. With the capacity of current generation sequencers mitochondrial enrichment strategies might seem outdated. Advantages of the here demonstrated method are that it ensures obtainment of the complete mitochondrial locus from even minute amounts of starting material, there are no negative costs associated with increasing genome sizes (no mitochondrial to nuclear ratio effect) and it diminishes the risk of erroneoulsy sequencing NUMTs.\n              ConclusionThis study shows that a complete mitogenome can be amplified and sequenced with high coverage from a single LR-PCR. The approach might be especially relevant in situations where only small amounts of starting material are available. Phylogeny reconstructions based on entire mitogenomes are promising to resolve deep level relationships within Stylommatophora, that could not be resolved using only 28S sequence data. Well supported groups from previous studies based on ten-fold less sequence data [7, 37] were reconfirmed. The region between COII and ATP8 is apparently a hot spot for rearrangements in stylommatophoran mitogenomes. The ‘Achatinoid’ clade is a basal branch in Stylommatophora and has the same mitochondrial gene arrangement as closely related non-Stylommatophoran taxa (especially from the clade Hygrophila). Rearrangements in mitochondrial gene order can characterize different stylommatophoran ranks, e.g. (non-) ‘Achatinoid’ clade, Orthurethra, Helicidae and Bradybaenidae.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe are grateful to M.

In our study, we found a de novo 1q42 deletion in a boy who did not have a cleft palate or a congenital diaphragmatic hernia but presented with psychomotor retardation. A 1.9 Mb deletion located within 1q42.11-q42.12 was validated at the molecular cytogenetic level. This is the first report of a 1q42.11-q42.12 deletion in a patient with onlypsychomotor retardation. The precise break points could facilitate the discovery of potential causative genes, such as LBR, EPHX1, etc. The correlation between the psychomotor retardation and the underlying genetic factors could not only shed light on the diagnosis of psychomotor retardation at the genetic level but also provide potential therapeutic targets.Keywords1q42 deletionPsychomotor retardationGenotype-phenotype correlationMicroarray analysisIntroductionPsychomotor retardation has always been described as a slowing of physical and emotional reactions and shared similarities with depression [1]. As a component of depression, psychomotor retardation could provide clinical and therapeutic clues for effective treatments [2]. Specifically, depressed patients were usually classified as melancholic or non-melancholic based on their psychomotor symptoms [3]. Several studies have shown the correlation between psychomotor retardation and depression severity [4, 5]. Furthermore, psychomotor retardation has been speculated to be a potential pathognomonic factor for melancholia [6]. Thus far, a series of indexes has been developed for measuring psychomotor retardation, such as drawing tasks and cognitive, motor, speech and biological tests [7–10]. Although the measurements of psychomotor retardation have been detailed, the underlying genetic pathogenic factors are not well-known.Table 1\n                      Phenotypical comparison of our patient and reported patients with 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome\n                    Patient/sourceOur patientRice et al., 2006 [41]Mazzeu et al.,2010 [42]Jun et. al.,2013 [43]Filges et al., 2010 [20]Decipher 1015Decipher 266948Decipher 300673Coordinatea (chr1:)224086911-226016203219978228-225359888219894313-229156924223104211-223287570221885000-227340000220916999-226162869222694079-227147000222821378-226677842Deletion size1.9 Mb5.4 Mb1 Mb183 Kb5.45 Mb5.25 Mb4.45 Mb3.86 MbInheritance/originde novounknownDe novode novode novode novode novounknownBrain Defect-++++NRNRNRCleft Palate-++-++++Hypotonia-+NR+-NR+NRHeart Defect--+--+--Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia-----+--Seizures++-++---Psychomotor Retardation+-------Number of Involved Genesb13>50>202>50>40>60>50\n                    \n                                 NR No Record\n                    \n                                 aGRCh37/hg19 was used in coordinate\n                    \n                                 bRefSeq genes involved were counted in UCSC browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/)\n                  Copy number variations (CNVs) have been reported to be associated with dozens of complex diseases, including variant types of cancers, HIV-1/AIDS susceptibility and immunity-related diseases [11–13]. According to previous reports, CNVs usually play an important role in gene dosage, gene disruption, gene fusion, and position effects where abnormal CNVs could cause various diseases [14, 15]. Compared with other deletions, cases with deletion at 1q41–q42 were rarely reported, and existing evidence mostly showed its correlation with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and Fryns syndrome [16, 17]. Here, we performed genomic screening using a microarray and discovered a de novo 1.9 Mb deletion at 1q42.11–q42.12 (chr1: 224,086,911-226,016,203) in a 4-year-old boy showing psychomotor retardation without CDH. Further analysis suggested the involvement of several OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) genes, such as dispatched 1 (DISP1) and homo sapiens H2.0-like homeobox (HLX). However, DISP1 and HLX always accompanied psychomotor retardation and, thus, were normal in our case.This study was conducted to refine the clinical presentation of a 1q42.11–q42.12 microdeletion and establish the genotype-phenotype correlation.Patient data\n                The proband was a 4-year-old boy referred to the Clinical Genetics Service for psychomotor retardation. The boy’s parents were unrelated, and both have uneventful family histories. It was reported that the patient was born by normal spontaneous delivery without intrauterine exposure to drugs or other potentially harmful factors. He began speaking single words at the age of 1 year and 8 months and started walking at approximately 2 years old. Mental retardation was observed since the age of 2, and he was diagnosed with psychomotor retardation. In addition, he was risible and particularly friendly to foreigners. A physical examination of the child showed no abnormalities.\n              MethodsConventional cytogenetic analysis and Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)\n                Peripheral blood samples were collected from three family members with informed consent. A cytogenetic analysis was performed with the standard collection of blood lymphocytes. Metaphase chromosomes were G-banded at 550 bands of resolution.\n                Metaphase FISH analysis on cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed using a combination of CEP1 (green) probe and single-copy DNA probes (RP11-496N12, 1q42.12, red) that were cloned in BACs (BlueGnome, UK). A minimum of 20 metaphase cells was assessed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).\n              Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA)–Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array analysis\n                Genomic DNAs were isolated from the peripheral blood samples using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The DNA concentrations were measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000 V.3.1.2; NanoDrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). The DNA was amplified, labelled and subjected to 250 ng of product to hybridize CytoScan HD arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Affymetrix CytoScan HD array covered over 2.7 million markers, of which 750,000 were SNPs that could be used for genotyping, and 1.9 million were non-polymorphic probes. The Chromosome Analysis Suite software package (Affymetrix) was used for all analyses.\n              ResultsCMA\n                The genome-wide array analysis of the proband showed a 1.9 Mb deletion at 1q42.11–q42.12 (see Fig. 1), ranging from chr1 as follows: 224,086,911-226,016,203 (GRCh37/hg19). However, his parents showed normal ploidy at the same region.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Microdeletion at 1q42.11-q42.12, which spans 1.9 Mb (illustrated with red box in the top)\n                      \n              FISH and real-time PCR\n                The FISH analysis of the parents showed in tegrated 1q42.11-q42.12, while the patient carried only one fragment copy at 1q42.11-q42.12 (see Fig. 2).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        FISH results of cells from the patient and his parents. Two copies of 1q42 were detected in the father (a) and mother (b), while only 1 copy of 1q42 was retained in the cells of the patient (c), thus identifying the deleted region at 1q42. The red fluorescence of 1q42 was indicated with a white arrowhead\n                      \n                In addition, the karyotypes of the parents and the boy were normal (see Fig. 3; data of parents not shown).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Karyotyping of the cells from the patient. Normal karyotyping was visualized via G-banding techniques with a resolution of 550 bands\n                      \n              DiscussionPsychomotor retardation could affect physical and emotional reactions and cause speech and walking abnormalities, which are also the most universal manifestations of major depression [1–4]. Furthermore, psychomotor retardation was also involved in adverse effects of drugs, such as benzodiazepines [18]. Since the roles of pathogenesis and important phenotypes in patients with depression remain unclear, the discovery of causative genes is critical. In our studies, the de novo 1.9 Mb microdeletion found at 1q42, which was accompanied by 1q41, was mostly reported as the critical region for CDH [17, 19]. However, the data in the Decipher database also suggested connections of common phenotypes in cleft palate, coarse facial features and intellectual disability with a deletion of 1q42.11-q42.12 (Table 1). Nevertheless, neither congenital diaphragmatic hernia nor facial flaw spresenting with signs of psychomotor retardation, such as learning to walk or talk at the age of 2, were observed in our proband. The reason for the sediscrepancies between our case and other reported patients with 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome is that the deletion in our case only affects the 1.9 Mb spectrum of 1q42 while 1q41q42 deletions of the latter mainly extend into the 1q41 region [17, 20–22].In the deleted 1.9 Mb range, we found 13 genes, including 7 OMIM genes. Among the seven OMIM genes, most were correlated with development. FBXO28 is characterized by an approximately 40-amino acid F-box motif and was reported to contribute to intellectual disability, seizures and a dysmorphological phenotype in patients with 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome [23, 24]. At the molecular level, FBXO28 could act as a master regulator of cellular homeostasis by targeting key proteins for ubiquitination. For example, FBXO28 could mediate the degradation of Alcat1 via targeting Alcat1 for monoubiquitination at K183. Meanwhile, FBXO28 could also function inubiquitylation-independent pathways, including the transmission of CDK activity to MYC function during the cell cycle [25, 26]. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to elaborate the detailed molecular pathogenic mechanism of FBXO28 in 1q41q42 syndrome. NVL, known as nuclear VPC (valosin containing protein)/p97-Like, is another OMIM gene belonging to the AAA-ATPase (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) super family. The major isoform of NVL is NVL2, which was mainly localized in the nucleus and participated in ribosome biosynthesis [27–29]. Wang et al have investigated 1045 major depressive disorder patients, 1235 schizophrenia patients and 1235 normal controls of Han Chinese origin and found that the NVL gene could confer risks for both major depressive disorder and schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population [30]. The high correlation between NVL and major depression suggested that NVL was a potential causative gene for psychomotor retardation. As a gene encoding an axonemal dynein heavy chain, the deletion of DNAH14 was associated with motile cilia function. Although DNAH14 is an important gene for motile cilia, further research is needed to understand its contribution to psychomotor retardation. SRP9 encodes a 9k Da signal recognition particle. A SRP9 and RP14 complex was reported to be involved in the elongation arrest function of SRP, which was important to the co translational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [31]. Furthermore, SRP9 also showed higher expression levels in human colorectal cancer [32]. To date, the importance of the role of SRP9 in its contribution to psychomotor retardation is not well-studied. LBR and EPHX1 genes are located in regions that are frequently deleted in 1q42.11q42.12 deletion syndrome and thus should be investigated because of their neuronal significance. LBR encoded lamin B receptor which belongs to ERG4/ERG24 family and was also shown to be a pivotal architectural protein that plays an important role in the nuclear envelope [33, 34]. Mutations in the LBR gene could also affect neutrophil segmentation and sterol reeducates activity. LBR was associated with two different recognized clinical conditions, Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA) and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia [35, 36]. On the other hand, GravemannS. et al. have shown that the copy number of LBR and nuclear segmentation index of neutrophils were highly correlated while the gene-dosage could affect granulopoiesis [37]. Recently, Mc Caffery JMand colleagues have found that the two SNPs (rs2230419 and rs1011319) in LBR were associated with baseline Beck Depression Inventory scores, which also suggested the potential role of the gene in depression. EPHX1 gene encoded epoxide hydrolase, a critical biotransformation enzyme that converted epoxides to trans-dihydrodiols that could be conjugated and excreted from the body [38]. The dysfunction of EPHX1 was reported to contribute to several human diseases, including neurodegeneration where its differential expression was presented in patients with Alzheimer’s disease [39]. Additionally, EPHX1 affected the cerebral metabolism of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and, hence regulated neuronal signal transmission in mice [40]. Although there is no direct evidence on the causal relationship between EPHX1 and psychomotor retardation, studies have revealed the important function of EPHX1 in neuron systems and suggested the potential role of EPHX1 in neuronal development, which if dysfunctional could lead to psychomotor retardation.The most common midline defects of 1q42.11–q42.12 deletion syndrome are cleft palate and CDH. However, these manifestations did not appear in our patients. Compared with patients with a cleft palate and CDH, the 1.9 Mb deletion region in our case did not cover DISP1 and Shh, which were reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of developmental defects and CDH [16, 20]. The normality of DISP1 and Shh seems to be the major reason for the absence of a cleft palate and CHD in our patient.The complex intra chromosomal gene interactions and positional effects are of great importance in complex patterns of midline defects and genes involved in developmental pathways. Our study of a 1q42.11–q42.12 deletion in a boy without a cleft palate but with psychomotor retardation has provided evidence regarding the genotype-phenotype correlation between a 1q42.11–q42.12 microdeletion and psychomotor retardation; especially important is the finding of potential causative genes, such as LBR and EPHX1, which could become therapeutic targets. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to explore the detailed molecular mechanism of psychomotor retardation pathogenesis.Abbreviations\n                CNVs: \n                    Copy number variations\n                  CDH: \n                    Congenital diaphragmatic hernia\n                  DISP1: \n                    Dispatched 1\n                  HLX: \n                    H2.0-like homeobox\n                  SNP: \n                    Single nucleotide polymorphism\n                  FISH: \n                    Fluorescence in situ hybridization\n                  CMA: \n                    Chromosomal microarray analysis\n                  OMIM: \n                    Online mendelian inheritance in man\n                  PHA: \n                    Pelger-Huet anomaly\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe are grateful to the patient and his parents for their participation in this study.

A total of 2,334,889 SLAF tags were generated to produce 2,309,777 SNPs. ADMIXTURE analysis revealed unstructured subpopulations for 33 accessions, indicating that this orchardgrass population could be used for association analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed an average r2 of 0.4 across all SNP pairs, indicating a high extent of LD in these samples. Through GWAS, a total of 4,604 SNPs were found to be significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) associated with the rust trait. The bulk analysis discovered a number of 5,211 SNPs related to rust trait. Two candidate genes, including cytochrome P450, and prolamin were implicated in disease resistance through prediction of functional genes surrounding each high-quality SNP (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) associated with rust traits based on GWAS analysis and bulk analysis\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The large number of SNPs associated with rust traits and these two candidate genes may provide the basis for further research on rust resistance mechanisms and marker-assisted selection (MAS) for rust-resistant lineages.\n              KeywordsGenome-wide association studyOrchardgrassRust diseaseSLAF-seqBackgroundOrchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) is a cool-season forage grass that is wildly cultivated in all mild, subtropical regions of the world [1]. Due to its high yield, high nutritional value, and shade tolerance, it has become a valuable pasture species in China [2]. However, orchardgrass is frequently infected by rust disease, which leads to low yield and poor quality [3].Several studies on rust disease in orchardgrass have been reported. Tajimi et al. [4] studied orchardgrass clonal lines and found that the rusts of orchardgrass, timothy, and ryegrass were closely related and that stem rust was under the genetic control of orchardgrass. Miller and Carlson [5] evaluated rust resistance in orchardgrass based on both phenotypic performance and a polycross progeny test through phenotypic selection. Yan et al. [6] investigated 242 germplasm resources of orchardgrass for 2 years, finding that 13 accessions exhibited high resistance to rust disease. However, the phenotype of an organism can be influenced by both its genotype and its environment. To better assess the impact of this disease, additional methods are needed to study the desirable genetic traits for these plants.Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have become one of the most commonly strategies for identifying genes underlying complex traits in plants. In model species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, the potential of GWAS to reveal genetic traits has been demonstrated successfully by the functional validation of the accelerated cell death 6 (ACD6) gene [7]. This approach has also been used to develop a precise estimation of variation in traits such as flowering time [8] of Arabidopsis thaliana, leaf architecture [9] of maize (Zea mays), and blight resistance [10] of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).In recent studies on rice (Oryza sativa), several genes that have large effects on traits involved in determining yield, morphology, and salinity tolerance have been identified [11–13]. In the past few years, flowering time genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare) [14], the PsyI-AI locus in wheat [15], and the rhg-1 gene in soybean (Glycine max) [16] have been identified as candidate genes [17] through GWAS. Rust disease has seriously influenced plant growth and development, so some studies focus on conducting GWAS to plant rust disease. For example, a GWAS was conducted using 232 winter wheat breeding lines to identify loci conferring resistance to Ug99 that is a new race of stem rust and threatens global wheat production, and 12 loci associated with Ug99 resistance were discovered in this study [18]. A number of 177 oat (Avena sativa) accessions were evaluated for disease resistance and further genotyped with 15,000 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 31 simple sequence repeat and markers to disclose association with disease resistance trait and found five markers were associated with rust resistance [19].Consequently, several reduced-representation sequencing technologies, including restriction site-associated sequencing (RADseq), double digest RADseq, and two-enzyme genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), were developed as cost-effective methods for SNP discovery and high-throughput genotyping [20]. Recently, specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), a more efficient solution for large-scale genotyping, was developed by Sun et al. [21]. This approach involves several distinguishing characteristics: (1) fine-mapping resolution among founders can be performed given a high-density of genotypes; (2) outcrossing reshuffles variation in the founder genomes, providing some control over population structure effects; (3) joint-linkage mapping identifies low-resolution quantitative trait loci (QTLs) across all recombinant inbred line (RIL) families, and this genetic background can be controlled while performing nested associations for fine mapping; and (4) the use of RILs allows repeated measurement of phenotypes on the same lines in common and different environments [22]. This approach has previously been used successfully to perform GWAS [23].SLAF-seq is highly automated due to the development of bioinformatics tools and high-throughput sequencing technology applications. SLAF sequencing methods ascertain the uniformity, efficiency, and density of marker development, and they have been applied in several studies. For example, Li et al. [24] constructed a high-density soybean genetic map to discover QTLs pertaining to isoflavone content that were consistent across various environments; Wei et al. [25] established a high-density SNP map for cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) through SLAF-seq to detect fruit-related QTLs. Additional studies have created high-density genetic maps in order to provide a platform for gene/QTL fine-mapping [20, 26, 27]. These studies showed that SLAF-seq methods are used primarily to construct genetic maps for discovering valuable QTLs; however, for QTL mapping, a large investment of time is needed to establish mapping populations, and the intensive labor required may be a limitation for identification of specific traits. To avoid the limitations of this approach, GWAS is a reliable method used to confirm molecular markers relating to important economic traits. SNP markers that cover the entire genome may be analyzed without the construction of mapping populations [28]. Moreover, several studies have used used SLAF-seq for GWAS [23, 29–31].In this study, we use the SLAF-seq technology to perform a GWAS of rust traits in orchardgrass to identify the associated SNPs and predict functional genes. These results will provide a basis for orchardgrass breeding and may be helpful in enhancing rust resistance in orchardgrass.Results and DiscussionSequence and quality statistics\n                A total of 76.74 M reads were obtained from this experiment.

These SLAF tags were divided into three types: Marker (polymorphism tags), No ploy (no polymorphism tags), and Repeat (SLAF tags on repeat sequences) (Table 1). PLINK (v1.07) [32] was used to carry out quality control of the data. Those SNPs with low integrity (<85%), low minor allele frequency (<5%), and insufficient reads (<90%) were discarded. After filtration, 2,309,777 SNPs were used for further analysis.Table 1\n                        The statistical results for each type of SLAF tags\n                      TypeMarkerNoPolyRepeatTotalNumber643 0081 689 4092 4722 334 889Percent27.54%72.36%0.11%100%\n                      Note: Marker, pleomorphic tags; Nopoly, non-pleomorphic tags; Repeat: SLAF tags on repeat sequence\n                    \n              Phylogenetic analysis\n                The 33 orchardgrass samples could not be clearly divided into subgroups by the neighbor-joining analysis using MEGA software. However, the results from this phylogenetic analysis showed that the HS (high susceptibility of disease) materials were relatively concentrated, comparing with HR (high level of resistance of disease) materials (Fig. 1).\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        The evolutionary tree of 33 orchardgrass accessions. The branch indicates each material. The red line is HS materials, and blue line is HR materials\n                      \n              Group structure and clustering analysis\n                The best dataset was produced by using a K-value of 2, indicating that our samples probably derived from 2 ancestors. With the maximum membership probability, 5 accessions were assigned to group 1 (G1), while 28 accessions were assigned to group 2 (G2). All 5 accessions from G1 were HR samples, and all 16 HS accessions (16) were included in G2 (Fig. 2).\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Two subgroups inferred from ADMIXTURE analysis. The vertical coordinated of each subgroup means the membership coefficients for each accession. The digits of the horizontal coordinate represent the accessions according to Table 3. Green zone: G1; Blue zone: G2. The blue line means HR materials; The red line means HS materials\n                      \n                We applied a clustering strategy to the samples with ADMIXTURE software. This method has been used with large sample sizes, exhibiting a strong capability to assign individuals into populations. The best dataset (K<U+2009>=<U+2009>2) showed that our samples probably derive from two ancestors. It is important to use population-based methods to separate accessions from mixed populations into unstructured subpopulations, allowing for association analyses between phenotypes and molecular bands to be conducted in homogeneous subpopulations [33, 34]. In this study, the accessions associated with resistant and susceptible traits remained in G1, indicating that this orchardgrass population could be used for association analysis.\n              PCA analysis\n                A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the 2,309,777 SNPs from all 33 accessions to estimate the clusters of population. Principal Component 1 (PC1) explained 7.94% of the variation in the genotypic data, while PC2 and PC3 explained 5.20% and 2.57% of the variation, respectively. Although there are intermediate accessions that make the groupings less clear, the PCA results indicate that the HS samples can be clustered into one group (Fig. 3).\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        The PCA analysis of 33 orchardgrass accessions. The red balls mean HS materials; the blue balls mean HR materials\n                      \n                Based on analysis of 2,309,777 SNPs, a neighbor-joining tree was constructed using MEGA software. The results from the phylogenetic analysis showed that the 33 orchardgrass samples could not be clearly divided into two major clusters (Fig. 1), though the 16 HS individuals were able to cluster into one group as shown in the PCA results (Fig. 3). This indicates that there may be no strong relationship between rust resistance and genetic background. Several individuals appeared to be intermediates between the two groups, making the distinction between groups less clear; it may be that we lack a sufficient number of individuals in our sample to appropriately delineate the groups.\n              Linkage disequilibrium analysis\n                The 2,309,777 SNPs generated from the 2,334,889 SLAF markers with unknown chromosome information were used to evaluate the extent of LD in the 33 orchardgrass accessions. In total, 9,345,646 pairs of SNPs were detected and an r2 value was calculated for each pair. The values ranged from 0.0000 to 1.0000, with an average r2 of 0.4, indicating a substantial amount of LD existing in these SNPs. Of the 9,345,646 pairs, 7,270 (0.08%) were considered to be in LD with strong linkage at r2<U+2009>><U+2009>0.8 (Additional file 2).\n              GWAS analysis and bulk analysis\n                The association analysis between SNP markers and the rust trait was performed using TASSEL to search for associated tags and allelic variation. After general linear model (GLM) analysis of 2,309,777 SNPs, 4,604 SNPs were significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) associated with the rust trait (Additional file 3). At a more stringent P-value cutoff of<U+2009><<U+2009>0.001, 1,761 SNPs were still associated with the rust trait (Additional file 4). The bulk analysis was conducted to discover 69,690 SNPs related to the rust trait, and a total number of 5,211 SNPs were filtered when the SNP index is over 0.3 (Additional file 5).\n              Bioinformatics analysis of candidate genes\n                We predicted 555 genes from these 4,604 SNPs in our study (Additional file 6) through GWAS analysis, and only four candidate genes, including cytochrome P450, Pc68LrkC4, prolamin, and EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein (TaCab1), were implicated with disease resistance in the Nonredundant NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT) database, and their predicted molecular functions and biological processes are specified in Table 2.Table 2\n                        Bioinformatics analysis of candidate genes\n                      SLAF markerE_valueNearest genePredict FunctionMarker107475.00E-18Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker110292.00E-12Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker13729a2.00E-17Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker1700a5.00E-13Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker31245.00E-18Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker336805.00E-18Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker400812.00E-11Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker40152.00E-27Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker47282.00E-27Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker53891.00E-08Cytochrome P450Resist pathogenic bacterialMarker125656.00E-22Pc68LrkC4Activate chemical reactionsMarker23129438.00E-16Pc68LrkC4Activate chemical reactionsMarker26491.00E-24Prolamin geneRegulate stripe rust resistanceMarker10408a1.00E-08Prolamin geneRegulate stripe rust resistanceMarker210448.00E-21TaCab1Regulate stripe rust resistance\n                      Note: ameans that makers have also been found in bulk analysis\n                    \n                Four genes, including cytochrome P450, Pc68LrkC4, prolamin, and TaCab1, were discovered by detecting genes surrounding each candidate SNP (<1 Mb). Cytochrome P450 plays an important role in the synthesis of secondary metabolites of fungi and metabolism of foreign compounds [35]. Studies on Populus tomentosa infected by stripe rust showed that Cytochrome P450 is one of the genes related to germ defense [36]. Pc68LrkC4 was isolated from Avena sativa and contains a retrotransposon and repetitive DNA linked to a receptor kinase gene. It has been shown that the leaf rust resistance gene Lr10 of Triticum aestivum encodes an extracellular receptor protein kinase with similar domains [37]. Several studies on prolamin have found that proteins with the same or similar rust resistance are closely related to prolamin, and most of these cluster in dendrograms. For example, wheat stripe rust resistance was related to the genetic distance of prolamin, guessing it might because wheat stripe rust gene and partial encoded gene of prolamin were chained on 1BS [38, 39]. In affinity reactions between wheat and stripe rust, the expression of the TaCab1 gene increases significantly. At addition, its expression can be induced by several different biotic stresses. The TaCab1 gene exhibits a marked change in expression after being treated with CaCl2. Researchers have guessed that TaCab1 plays a role in the interaction between wheat and stripe rust via Ca2+ transport. In addition, TaCab1 gene silencing increases wheat’s resistance to stripe rust. Therefore, researchers have shown that the TaCab1 gene is correlated with susceptibility to stripe rust [40]. In conclusion, these four candidate genes play important roles in disease progression, particularly the TaCab1 gene. This indicates that these candidate genes are likely to be critical in orchardgrass resistance to rust disease.\n                We also associated the results between GWAS analysis and bulk analysis to confirm these four predicted genes; however, two types of analysis only shared three markers representing two predicted genes including Cytochrome P450 and Prolamin gene (Table 2). Therefore, these two genes might be more reliable for regulation mechanism of rust resistance in orchgardgrass.\n              MethodExperimental materials\n                A total of 33 orchardgrass accessions, with high level of resistance of disease (HR) and high susceptibility of disease (HS), as evaluated by Yan et al. [6], were chosen for the experiment, including 17 with HR and 16 with HS in 2011 or 2012 (Table 3). The germplasm of orchardgrass used in this study consisted of 33 accessions that originated from Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania. For each accession, 10 individuals were randomly, and 0.5 g of clean young leaves were selected per plant in 2014 for further DNA extraction.Table 3\n                        The detailed information about accession number, name, origin, and rust resistance in orchardgrass for 2011 and 2012\n                      NumberAccession nameOrigin20112012101819-6Beijing,ChinaHSHS201824-2Beijing,ChinaHRHR302122-5Hubei,ChinaHRHR4231469-1LibyaHSHS52410-2Xinjiang,ChinaHSHS62410-6Xinjiang,ChinaHSHS72410-7Xinjiang,ChinaHSHS8287804-1SpainHSHS9287804-2SpainHSHS10287804-3SpainHSHS11287804-4SpainHSHS12287804-5SpainHSHS13287804-8SpainHSHS14292587-1IsraelHSHS15302884-3SpainHSHS16308794-1IndiaHRHR17308794-2IndiaHRHR18308794-3IndiaHRHR19308794-5IndiaHRHR20308794-7IndiaHRHR21308794-8IndiaHRHR22325293-2Russian FederationHRHR23325293-4Russian FederationHRHR24325293-5Russian FederationHRHR25325293-6Russian FederationHRHR26325293-7Russian FederationHRHR27325293-8Russian FederationHRHR28578635-7MoroccoHSHS29578635-8MoroccoHSHS3079-118-2NetherlandsHSHS31woronowii(H12)-3New ZealandHRHR32woronowii(H12)-4New ZealandHRHR33woronowii(H12)-7New ZealandHRHR\n                      Note: HR high resistance, HS high sense of disease\n                    \n              Specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing\n                Total orchardgrass genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen USA); the quality and quantity of DNA was then inspected using 0.8% gel electophoresis. The quantified DNA was diluted to 20 µg/µL and was stored at -20 °C before use.\n                The orchardgrass genomic DNA was analyzed with SLAF-seq [21]. Sequencing libraries of each accession were constructed through digestion with the restriction enzyme HaeIII, (New England Biolabs, USA). A single nucleotide (A) overhang was added to the digested fragments with Klenow Fragment (3'<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>5´ exo–) (New England Biolabs, USA) and dATP at 37 °C, and then duplex tag-labeled sequencing adapters (PAGE purified, Life Technologies, Beijing, China) were ligated to the A-tailed DNA with T4 DNA ligase. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and pooled. The pooled sample was separated via electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. Fragments with indexes and adaptors from 400 to 450 bp were excised and purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Duesseldorf, Germany). Finally, the gel-purified product was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The average depth of sequencing was 6.7×. After sequencing, low-quality reads were filtered out (quality score<U+2009><<U+2009>20). Reads with double ends were compared with similar sequences that could be labelled as a candidate SLAF to proceed with the next step. SNPs with low minor allele frequencies (<5%) and low call frequencies (<85%) were deleted [32]. Finally, 33 samples and 2,309,777 SNPs remained for genome-wide association analysis (Additional file 7: Table S2).\n              Phylogenetic analysis\n                Based on the SNP genotype data from the 33 orchardgrass samples, a dendrogram was constructed in MEGA5 [41] using the neighbor-joining algorithm [42]. The structure of the orchardgrass population was analyzed using ADMIXTURE software based on SNP genotype data [43]. The pre-defined K, which indicates the number of groups in a population, varied from 1 to 10 in ADMIXTURE models. A K value was selected when the estimate of lnPr(X|K) peaked in the range of 1 to 10 subpopulations. Delta K (<U+25B3>K), as an ad hoc quantity related to the second order change in the log probability of the data with respect to the number of clusters, was considered as the most probable value of K according to the model choice criteria [42]. A PCA approach with the cluster software [44] was used to cluster the orchardgrass population.\n              Evaluation of linkage disequilibrium and GWAS analysis\n                The squared correlations (r2) between all combinations of SNPs (2,309,777) were used to evaluate the significance of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) using Haploview [45] (http://www.softpedia.com/get/Science-CAD/Haploview.shtml). Each pair of SNPs was considered to have strong linkage if r2<U+2009>><U+2009>0.8. Based on SNP genotype data, the GWAS analysis was conducted using a GLM in the TASSEL software [43] as follows:$$ \\mathrm{Y}=\\mathrm{X}\\upalpha +\\mathrm{Q}\\upbeta +\\mathrm{K}\\upmu +\\mathrm{e}\\mathrm{Y} $$\n                        \n                where y is the phenotype value, Q is the population structure matrix calculated by the ADMIXTURE program, X is the genotype matrix, a is the effect of genotype, ß is the effect of population structure, µ is the effect of kinship, and e is the residual error. Finally, each SNP locus was assigned a value associated with related traits.\n              Bulk analysis\n                Two groups (HS and HR) were used to conduct a bulk analysis, and the procedures were followed as previously described [46]. To identify potential trait-retaled SNPs, we aligned the short reads obtained from the two DNA bulks to the reference genome (sequences from the HR group were regarded as reference genome) using bwa software [47], and alignment files were converted to SAM/BAM files using SAMtools [48]. SNP-index was calculated for all the SNP positions. We further excluded SNP positions with SNP-index of <0.3 from the two sequences to avoid spurious SNPs called due to alignment errors.\n              Bioinformatics analysis of candidate regions\n                The genetic data relating to rust traits of a 500-Kb window surrounding each SNP were downloaded from Ensembl (http://ensemblgenomes.org/) and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The NT databases were used to conduct pathway analysis and functional annotation for predicted genes [49].\n              ConclusionsIn this study, SLAF-seq technology was used to conduct the GWAS in orchardgrass, and a number of 2,334,889 SLAF tags were produced to generate 2,309,777 SNPs. The GWAS showed that a total number of 4,604 SNPs were significantly (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.01) associated with the rust trait, while a total number of 5,211 SNPs were filtered by bulk analysis. Based on bioinformatics analysis for GWAS results, four candidate genes, including cytochrome P450, Pc68LrkC4, prolamin, and TaCab1 were predicted involving in disease resistance, and the bulk analysis further confirmed cytochrome P450 and prolamin genes were reliable. Besides, further research should be done to determine how these two genes work for resisting diseases. The results can also provide basic information for MAS of rust-resistant lineages.Abbreviations\n                ACD6: \n                    Cell death 6\n                  G1: \n                    Group 1\n                  G2: \n                    Group 2\n                  GBS: \n                    Genotyping-by-sequencing\n                  GLM: \n                    General linear model\n                  GWAS: \n                    Genome-wide association study\n                  HR: \n                    High level of resistance of disease\n                  HS: \n                    High susceptibility of disease\n                  LD: \n                    Linkage disequilibrium\n                  MAS: \n                    Marker-assisted selection\n                  NT: \n                    Nucleotide sequences\n                  PC: \n                    Principal component analysis\n                  PC1: \n                    Principal Component 1\n                  QTLs: \n                    Quantitative trait loci\n                  RADseq: \n                    Restriction site-associated sequencing\n                  RIL: \n                    Recombinant inbred line\n                  SLAF-seq: \n                    Specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing\n                  TaCab1: \n                    EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2014CB138705) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC (31101760).\n                Funding\n                This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2014CB138705), Science and technology commission of livelihoods and social security project, and construction and demonstration promotion of grass and sheep matching model under whole barn feeding conditions for goats in Chongqing (cstc2016shmszx0473), Agriculture committee project and forage grass laboratory construction project of goat industrial technology system in Chongqing, and Funding project of innovation team construction in chongqing universities: modern production technology of beef (CXTDG201602003).

In Sweden there are a number of local breeds, native breeds which have adapted to specific areas in Sweden, for which efforts are being made to keep them pure and healthy over time. One example of such a breed is the Swedish Gute sheep. The objective of this study was to estimate inbreeding and genetic diversity of Swedish Gute sheep.\n              \n                Results\n                Three datasets were analysed: pedigree information of the whole population, pedigree information for 100 animals of the population, and microsatellite genotypes for 94 of the 100 animals. The average inbreeding coefficient for lambs born during a six year time period (2007–2012) did not increase during that time period. The inbreeding calculated from the entire pedigree (0.038) and for a sample of the population (0.018) was very low. Sheep were more heterozygous at the microsatellite markers than expected (average multilocus heterozygosity and Ritland inbreeding estimates 1.01845 and -0.03931) and five of seven microsatellite markers were not in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium due to heterozygosity excess. The total effective population size estimated from the pedigree information was 155.4 and the average harmonic mean effective population size estimated from microsatellites was 88.3. Pedigree and microsatellite genotype estimations of inbreeding were consistent with a breeding program with the purpose of reducing inbreeding.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Our results showed that current breeding programs of the Swedish Gute sheep are consistent with efforts of keeping this breed viable and these breeding programs are an example for other small local breeds in conserving breeds for the future.\n              KeywordsMicrosatellite MarkerEffective Population SizeCoat ColourPedigree InformationSheep BreedBackgroundGute sheep are an ancient breed from the Swedish island and province of Gotland, belonging to the North European short-tailed sheep group. Both Gute sheep and in general North European short-tailed sheep are characterized in part by their hardiness as well as coat colour and pattern variation [1]. Many of the North European short-tailed sheep breeds are decreasing in population size [1, 2] and have low heterogeneity [3]. However these breeds are unique and their conservation is relevant because they add to overall species diversity [3, 4]. The Gute sheep population experienced a severe bottleneck when polled sheep started to become more popular on Gotland and the horned sheep became rare. Beginning around 1920 the remaining horned sheep on Gotland were gathered by a few individuals interested in preserving the horned sheep. These sheep are the origins of the existing Gute sheep population today (personal communication with Gute sheep breed organizations in Sweden). Nevertheless, Gute sheep, unlike some other North European short-tailed sheep breeds, are not endangered at the moment, although the population is believed to be decreasing in size [2]. Thanks to conservation efforts, there were an estimated 5200 animals in Sweden in 2012 [2]. The first association working with the conservation of the Gute sheep, Föreningen Gutefåret, was formed in 1977, and an additional association, GutefårAkademin, was formed in 2007. Gute sheep breeding is focused on preserving the breed and not on improving production traits.Gute sheep appear in the scientific literature, having been studied for both coat colour and population structure and genetic diversity. Classical genetic studies from the 1970s took advantage of the coat colour variation in Gute sheep, also then referred to as Goth sheep in English, to study coat colour inheritance in sheep [5]. More recently, there have been population genetic studies which have included Gute sheep [3, 6], but these studies only had a small number of individuals; 20 and 12 respectively. There have been no studies of Gute sheep genetic diversity using pedigree information.The objectives of this study were to estimate inbreeding and genetic diversity of Swedish Gute sheep using pedigree data and microsatellite genotypes to identify; if the population is at potential risk due to high or increasing inbreeding and decreased genetic diversity; and if strategies need to be implemented to conserve the Swedish Gute sheep in the future.MethodsData\n                Pedigree information for all registered Gute sheep in Sweden born from 1960 to 2014 was provided by Elitlamm, the recording program for sheep in Sweden. For the early records only a small proportion of the population were registered in ElitLamm, but in recent years a very large proportion of the Gute sheep population in Sweden has been registered in ElitLamm because animals must be registered in order to be entitled to financial support for the keeping of endangered breeds. Pedigree information included animal identification numbers, year of birth and parent identification numbers. The animal identification numbers were anonymous.\n                Blood samples and phenotypic records (tail length and information about horns) were collected from different parts of Sweden by a trained technician in collaboration with the association “Föreningen Gutefåret”, one of the two Gute sheep breed organizations in Sweden. Ethical permission to collect blood samples from sheep and use for genetic studies was approved before the study (Dnr C102/13). Samples were stored in the -80 °C freezer of the SLU biobank. DNA was extracted from blood samples for 100 Gute sheep from a total of 13 flocks using the DNeasy mini kit for the QIAsymphony robot (Qiagen®, Hilden, Germany). Sheep were genotyped for a total of eight genetic markers; AME, a SNP marker in the amelogenin gene for sex determination; and seven microsatellite markers (INRA005, INRA023, INRA063, INRA172, MAF214, MAF65 and McM527). These markers are part of the ISAG kit for parentage testing. Genotyping was done at the certified lab at the Department of Animal Breeding and Genetics, SLU. The pedigree information for the 100 animals included flock identification, date of birth and official animal identification numbers for each animal, and their ancestors (which did not correspond with the anonymous animal identification numbers of the pedigree of the whole population).\n              Analyses\n                Pedigree information of the whole population was used to estimate population parameters. Generation intervals, effective number of founders, effective number of ancestors, effective number of founder genomes and marginal contributions of ancestors were estimated with the software Pedig [7]. Generation interval for sires of sires, dams of sires, sires of dams and dams of dams were calculated separately. The average was calculated from these four values and used as the overall generation interval. The coefficient of inbreeding by birth year [8], pedigree completeness indices, number of complete generation equivalents and average coancestry within birth cohorts were estimated with software, EVA [9]. Effective population size was calculated as one divided by double the annual rate of inbreeding multiplied by the generation interval [10].\n                The pedigree information for each of the 100 sheep with blood samples available were combined into one pedigree. This pedigree was used for calculating average coefficient of inbreeding and pedigree completeness with the software EVA [9] for comparison with results for these parameters from the whole pedigree.\n                Diversity within populations (1-QINTRA) and between populations (1-QINTER), inbreeding in individuals compared with the population inbreeding (FIS), and Hardy Weinberg tests for heterozygosity deficiency and excess in microsatellite markers were estimated with the program Genepop v.4.3 [11]. Inbreeding and relatedness among individuals [12] were estimated using the microsatellite genotypes using software Coancestry v.1.0.1.5 [13]. Multilocus heterozygosity was calculated as the proportion of typed loci at which an individual was heterozygous divided by the population heterozygosity at those same loci [14]. Past changes in effective population size (average harmonic mean effective population size) were estimated using microsatellite genotypes in the software VarEff v.1.2 [15] with an assumed mutation rate of 0.00013 [16] and generation interval 3 years. Population structure was estimated with the microsatellite genotypes using principal components analysis (PCA) using R package adegenet [17].\n              ResultsA total of 70 474 Gute sheep births were recorded in our dataset since 1960, with 30 616 recorded births during the last six years (2007 to 2012) (Fig. 1). Animals born from 2007 to 2012 had a pedigree completion index for three generations greater than 0.8. The average generation interval for this cohort was 3.6 years with generation intervals for sires being longer than for dams (Table 1), the total effective population size was 155.4 (Table 1) and the average inbreeding and average coancestry were low (0.038 and 0.007) (Fig. 2a and b). The distributions of inbreeding coefficients of animals born in 2007 and 2012 are in Fig. 2c. Measures of diversity and changes in population structure including effective number of founders, effective number of ancestors and effective number of founder genomes are reported in Table 1. From 1994 to 2003, the average inbreeding coefficient increased every year (from 0.0003 in 1994 to 0.037 in 2003), however, from 2003 to 2012 the average inbreeding coefficient remained relatively constant.\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Total number of Gute sheep recorded in Sweden by birth year\n                    Table 1\n                      Generation interval (L) and effective population size (Ne) for Gute sheep in Sweden between 2007 and 2012 calculated using pedigree\n                     MalesFemalesGeneration interval (L) in years3.73.5Effective population size (Ne)152.8157.7Number of founders575715Effective number of founders204.6225.7Effective number of founder genomes45.552.8Effective number of ancestors109.6122.1\n                    Number of founders, effective number of founders, effective number of founder genomes and effective number of ancestors calculated using pedigree in all recorded Swedish Gute sheep\n                  \n                    \n                  Fig. 2\n                      \n                                    a Average inbreeding coefficient, b average coancestry for Gute sheep by birth year from 2007-2012 and c distribution of inbreeding coefficients of animals born in 2007 (solid grey line) and 2012 (dashed black line)\n                    A total of 94 animals (19 males and 75 females) from 13 flocks were successfully genotyped (Additional file 1: Table S1). All of the 94 genotyped animals had horns (which is typical for this breed). Average tail length was 14.2 cm (standard deviation: 1.45) with tail length ranging from 11 cm to 18 cm. The average inbreeding coefficient estimated from the pedigree was 0.018. The number of alleles per microsatellite marker ranged from three to seven. Five of seven of the microsatellite markers were not in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium due to excess heterozygosity (Additional file 1: Table S2). On average, flocks had excess heterozygosity (average FIS<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.1102) and high diversity within and among flocks (1-QINTRA<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.7102 and 1-QINTER<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6437) (Additional file 1: Table S3). This was also verified by the analysis of individual animals, which showed excess heterozygosity and high diversity within and among individuals (FIS<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.0561, 1-QINTRA<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.7190 and 1-QINTER<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.6808). Average Ritland inbreeding calculated for the 94 animals was low (F<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.018). Multilocus heterozygosity and inbreeding calculated from microsatellites was highly correlated (0.90). The heterozygosity calculated using both methods was, on average, higher than expected (1.01845 and -0.03931). Inbreeding calculated from the pedigree had low correlations with both multilocus heterozygosity and inbreeding calculated from microsatellite markers (0.36 and 0.29). The average harmonic mean effective population size estimated from microsatellites has decreased by 4.2 (92.5 to 88.3) in the past five generations (~15 years). Using principal component analysis (PCA) to detect population structure revealed that individuals from all thirteen flocks generally cluster together in one group (Fig. 3). There were three individuals who were separate from the main cluster however these individuals were missing the same microsatellite genotypes and their position in the plot in Fig. 3 is likely a result of this.\n                    \n                  Fig. 3\n                      Population structure of Gute sheep genotyped with seven microsatellites using principal component analysis. Principal components 1 and 2 for individuals were plotted (shapes indicate which flock they were from)\n                    DiscussionWe present the first analyses of genetic diversity of the Gute sheep population in Sweden. Pedigree and microsatellite genotype estimations of inbreeding were consistent with a breeding program aiming at reducing inbreeding.Previous studies have suggested that Gute sheep is a unique breed with low heterogeneity [3, 4], which we could not verify in our study. Tapio et al. estimated inbreeding in 32 north European sheep breeds, including Gute sheep, using microsatellite markers [3]. All breeds in their study had greater FIS estimates than our estimate for Swedish Gute sheep and many of the FIS estimates indicated inbred populations (including for their Gute sheep population) [3]. The heterogeneity in our study was higher than expected in the population, both seen in the multilocus heterozygosity (1.01845) and the fact that five out of seven microsatellite markers were not in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium because of excess heterozygosity. In addition, inbreeding calculated from the entire pedigree, from the pedigree of the 94 individuals and from their microsatellite markers was low. The following could have contributed to differences in results: our diversity and inbreeding estimates are from animals born after animals studied by Tapio et al. [3]. Furthermore, we used pedigree data from the entire registered Swedish population and genotyped 94 animals from 13 different flocks with microsatellite genotypes while only 20 animals had been genotyped in the previous study [3]. Finally, we only used seven microsatellite markers compared to the 25 used by Tapio et al. [3] and this is a weakness of our study.Inbreeding estimated based on data from the entire pedigree was more than twice the estimated inbreeding from the sample population (0.038 versus 0.018) which could be due to the amount of pedigree information available for each animal. The entire pedigree is more complete and has more depth: the average depth of the entire population pedigree in generations was 6.06 compared in contrast with 5.41 for the sample population. The founders of a pedigree are assumed to be unrelated and when information from more generations is available, there could be more relationships accounted for. Nevertheless, both estimates of inbreeding were low and our hypothesis is, that this could be because neither of the datasets could account for bottlenecks occurring earlier in time (ie. Before pedigree information was collected). However, the estimation of inbreeding from microsatellite genotypes of the sample population, should be able to account for historical inbreeding, but the estimation of inbreeding from microsatellite data was also low (Ritland inbreeding<U+2009>=<U+2009>-0.03931). We are therefore confident, that our estimation of a low inbreeding reflects reality.This was also verified by the further analysis, which indeed indicated the existence of bottlenecks in the population. The difference between the effective number of founders and the effective number of ancestors indicated that bottlenecks have occurred in this population and the difference of half the effective population size and the effective number of founder genomes indicated that drift has been accelerating since the founder population.Previous studies found heterozygote deficiency in European sheep breeds (including North European short-tailed breeds), which was thought to be due to subdivision among flocks creating the Wahlund effect and due to non-random mating [3, 18–21]. In contrast we found that there was excess heterozygosity in Swedish Gute sheep. Excess heterozygosity in microsatellites in a population can be due to the structure of the breeding program, where unrelated animals are bred together as typically found in a population within a conservation program. For the sample population genotyped, 95% of animals had parents with different flock ID numbers indicating that they were born in different flocks, consistent with the breeding of animals that are unrelated. The use of pedigree information in a conservation breeding program has been shown to be a very powerful tool for maintaining genetic diversity and low inbreeding [22] and our study showed similar results.Heterozygosity and inbreeding calculated from microsatellite markers were highly correlated with each other but were not with inbreeding calculated from the pedigree. Regardless, we can conclude from these results that there was low inbreeding. Multilocus heterozygosity is not a good indicator of inbreeding calculated from a pedigree because it is not highly correlated unless there is a large amount of variation in inbreeding in a population [23] and heterozygosity can be lost at a different rate than inbreeding is gained in a population [24]. Additionally, correlation between these estimates can be lower because of amount and quality of information in the recorded pedigree. In a study of Finnsheep, estimates of inbreeding were correlated, however, estimates were not as correlated in one subpopulation of Finnsheep (grey individuals) and the authors believed this was in part because of their less complete pedigree [25].The effective population size estimated from microsatellites was 88.3, which was lower than the effective population size calculated from the whole pedigree (155.4). However both of these estimates fall well within or even above the recommended effective population size for small populations, which should be at least between 50 and 100 [26, 27]. On the other hand it is still important to maintain the conservation breeding program and monitor progress because in order to maintain genetic variation in the long term, an effective population size of at least 500 is needed [28]. Nevertheless, the comparison of our results with that of earlier studies suggests that the current conservation strategy in the Swedish Gute sheep population is successful and should be maintained.ConclusionsThe Swedish Gute sheep population can be an example of conservation for other small local breeds.Despite evidence of historical bottlenecks, inbreeding estimates from the pedigree of all registered Gute sheep in Sweden and from the pedigree and microsatellite genotypes of a sample of the population indicated that the level of inbreeding was low and that inbreeding did not increase over the last six years of data analysed. While the Swedish Gute sheep population has an effective population size that is good for small populations, the current conservation program and monitoring of the average inbreeding should continue.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThe project was performed in collaboration with the Föreningen Gutefåret association.

Marker validation is essential for QTL studies, but the cost and workload are considerable when large numbers of markers need to be verified. Marker systems with low development costs would be most suitable for this task.\n              \n                Results\n                We have tested allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), tetra markers and a genotyping tool based on the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I to verify randomly selected SNP markers identified previously either with a SNP array or by genotyping by sequencing in rice and mungbean, respectively. The genotyping capacity of allele-specific PCR and tetra markers was affected by the sequence context surrounding the SNP; SNPs located in repeated sequences and in GC-rich stretches could not be correctly identified. In contrast, CEL-I digestion of mixed fragments produced from test and reference DNA reliably pinpointed the correct genotypes, yet scoring of the genotypes became complicated when multiple SNPs were present in the PCR fragments. A cost analysis showed that as long the sample number remains small, CEL-I genotyping is more cost-effective than tetra markers.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                CEL-I genotyping performed better in terms of genotyping accuracy and costs than tetra markers. The method is highly useful for validating SNPs in small to medium size germplasm panels.\n              KeywordsSingle nucleotide polymorphismGenotypingPCR-based markersCEL-IBackgroundSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have become the most widely used marker system for plant and animal genetic analyses. SNP arrays are available for a number of plant and animal species [1] and tools combining SNP detection and genotyping such as genotyping by sequencing (GBS) made the use of these markers in genetic studies feasible and affordable for virtually any organism, including non-model species (recently reviewed by [2]). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses may yield a considerable number of markers that require verification of their correctness and diagnostic capacity to predict a phenotype. Depending on the number of markers to be tested, SNP marker validation can be even more costly and laborious than the genotyping experiment itself.Several assay types are available for verifying SNP markers generated by GBS, SNP chips or similar technologies. Cost-effective commercial SNP assays are available [3], but the cost saving promised by these assays are only attained in routine genotyping, when large sample numbers are analyzed with the same assay. For validation, the number of genotypes used for testing a candidate marker is typically small, and only a few of these markers will be chosen for routine genotyping, while most markers will be discarded. In this situation, the high development costs for commercial assays are not compensated for by their low running costs, making these markers an expensive option for validation experiments. What is more, commercial SNP genotyping tools such as KASP or Taqman assays require specialized laboratory equipment, which might not be available in every genotyping lab, especially not in developing countries. Consequently, for marker validation, simple SNP genotyping tools with low development costs are preferred.Conversion of SNP markers to cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers is often used as a PCR-based method to genotype SNP markers [4], but similar to commercial kits, the method might not be practical for SNP validation. First, only a fraction of SNP markers can be converted to CAPS markers, and second, the restriction enzymes for CAPS assays cause similarly high development costs like commercial assays. dCAPS markers overcome the need for the SNP to fall within a restriction enzyme recognition site and eliminate the limitation that only a fraction of SNPs can be converted to dCAPS [5], but the marker development costs remain high, as a restriction enzyme is required to distinguish the SNP alleles. PCR with allele-specific primers of different length has been proposed as a simple and cost-effective tool for PCR-based SNP genotyping [6]. This method is very cheap and easy to perform, but may be constrained by the sequence context around the SNP, which restricts the options for primer design. Similarly, tetra-primer amplification has been described as an efficient low cost method for genotyping SNP markers [7–9]. This method uses two locus-specific outer primers that asymmetrically flank the SNP under investigation, and two allele-specific inner primers, which produce a larger fragment for one allele, and a smaller fragment for the second allele. The bands of different size produced by one inner and outer primer pair can be easily detected on polyacrylamide or agarose gels [8]. To increase the specificity of the genotyping assay, an additional mismatch base near the 3' end of the allele-specific primers can be added [8, 9]. The method may not work well for SNPs in cytosine and guanine-rich DNA regions, and restrictions for choosing the inner (allele-specific) primers may limit the assay performance and require laborious adjustments and assay optimization [10].SNP genotyping using the single strand specific nuclease CEL-I has been proposed previously [11, 12]. The mismatch-specific nuclease CEL-I is extracted at low cost by ammonium sulfate precipitation from common celery [13, 14]. It detects mismatches in DNA double strands with high sensitivity and is commonly used to identify point mutations in methods known as TILLING and Eco-TILLING [15]. CEL-I was used to genotype SNPs present in mixtures of relatively large PCR fragments (2,000 bp) derived from two individuals after denaturation and re-naturation of the fragments [11]. Previously reported protocols require stopping the enzyme reaction by adding EDTA, or even removing excess salt and concentrating the samples through precipitation, making the method relatively laborious [11].Rice is the most important field crop in Asia and mungbean is increasingly used as a rotation crop in rice production systems. Marker-assisted selection is routinely performed in rice breeding and becomes also popular for mungbean [16, 17]. Therefore, the present case study aimed to evaluate the performance and costs of low cost PCR-based SNP assays on these two crops. We have tested allele-specific PCR, tetra PCR and CEL-I digestion for their capacity to correctly validate the presence of SNPs previously identified in a rice germplasm panel genotyped by a GoldenGate assay, and in a bi-parental mungbean population, where SNPs were identified by GBS. Special consideration was given to streamline the assays to keep costs and labor requirements as low as possible. An ideal assay should have no or only minimal need for optimization, enabling designing and running a large number of assays for validation at minimal effort and cost. Therefore, in this study, no optimization and primer redesign was performed before assessing the performance and costs of the marker assays.MethodsPlant material and SNP markers\n                In a previous work, a set of 26 local Vietnamese Oryza sativa spp. japonica and spp. indica rice cultivars held in the National Crop Genebank of the Plant Resources Center of the Vietnam Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam, were submitted to genetic diversity analysis at the Plant Breeding, Genetics and Biotechnology Division of the International Rice Research Institute, Los Baños, Philippines, using a 288 SNPs sub-set of the 384-SNP GoldenGate chip on a Fluidigm EP1 system according to [18]. From the genotyping results, five SNPs were chosen at random for validation with allele-specific primers, tetra markers and CEL-I genotyping (Table 1). In total 10 out of the 26 lines (R1, R4, R5, R7, R10, R15, R17, R18, R20 and R25) were chosen for SNP validation by sequencing, as these lines, according to the GoldenGate assay, displayed different combinations of the 5 SNPs in homozygote or heterozygote state.Table 1\n                        Outer and inner primer for tetra markers for rice.

Putative SNP markers were identified in populations V2802 x NM94 and TC1966 x NM92 by genotyping by sequencing [17]. Eight putative SNPs detected in this effort were selected at random for testing tetra markers and CEL-I genotyping (Table 2). The SNPs that were verified by sequencing, tetra markers and CEL-I on the mapping parents, were validated in 139 F7 progenies of V2802 x NM94 and 61 F12 offspring of TC1966 x NM92.Table 2\n                        Outer and inner primer for tetra markers for mungbean.

PCR-fragments for sequencing were produced from DNA of the rice and mungbean genotypes using the outer primers listed in Tables 1 and 2. The PCR fragments were submitted to Sanger sequencing at Genomics Ltd, Taiwan and the forward and reverse sequence reads were assembled and analyzed in DNAStar version 7.1.\n              Allele-specific PCR\n                The allele-specific PCR technique was applied as described by [6]. This method uses three primers: a common forward primer and two allele-specific reverse primers, where the 3' prime end is specific for a SNP allele. In addition, each of the allele-specific primers contained a mismatch base near the 3' end to destabilize the hybridization with the target sequence and increase the specifity of the allele-specific primer. One allele-specific primer contained a five base random extension at the 5' site, and the primer for the second allele contained a 15 base extension, where the five 5' bases corresponded to the extension of the first primer. The different length of the primers should result in size differences of the amplification products derived from the different alleles visible after gel electrophoresis of the PCR fragments. Primers were designed after retrieving the SNP sequence context in the O. sativa reference at http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/rice/ using Primer3 http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/. The primer sequences and the amplicon sizes are shown in Table 3. PCR was performed on 20 ng genomic DNA in 15 µl reactions containing 0.2 µM of each primer, 200 µM of deoxyribonucleotides, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase on a DNA Gradient PCR machine (BIORAD) with an amplification profile of initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles with 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at an assay-specific temperature from 48 °C to 65 °C for 45 s, elongation at 72 °C for 45 s and terminal elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products (2 µL/sample) were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining under UV light.Table 3\n                        Allele-specific primers for rice\n                      Locus namePrimer nameFragment lengthCommon primerAllele-specific primer 1Allele-specific primer 24:22435296AS1219CGACAGGGAGAAATCCTGAA5’-GACTTGGCAGGTAAAACAGGTTACG-3'5’-CACTACAAAGGCTGTGGCAGGTAAAACAGGATAGA-3'5:44806AS2189GCCTTGCAGGCTCCTATTTT5’-AGTCAAAGCTTCAGGCTCTAGCTGC-3’5’-CGACTAACTGTGACTAAGCTTCAGGCTCTAGCATA-3’6:14504992AS3209CCTTGCCCTGTTATTCCTGA5’-CCAGTTTTCTCCTTGTGCCAGATTG-3’5’-GATGTCTACTCCAGTTTTCTCCTTGTGCCAGAGAA-3’7:3650191AS4293CAAGTTTGTAGGTGCTGACCA5’-GATCCTAACTGAAGTGAAAACAGCA3’5’-TGCGTCATAGGATCCTAACTGAAGTGAAAACACAC-3’9:6982338AS5162TTCTTGGGGTTGGCTACAAG5’-ACTGCTGTACTTGTATTTGCCGCAC-3’5’-CATTGTATTTTTACGTGTACTTGTATTTGCCGATT-3\n                      The allele-specific base, as well as the additionally introduced variant base near the 3’end are underlined. The primer extension sequences are printed in small letters. The fragment length excludes the extensions of the allele-specific primers\n                    \n              Tetra marker\n                Outer and inner primers for tetra markers were designed in Primer3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/) using the rice and mungbean reference sequences (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/rice/ and http://plantgenomics.snu.ac.kr/mediawiki-1.21.3/index.php/Main_Page). The additional mismatch base usually introduced for tetra ARMS PCR [8] was not applied in our experiment. The outer and inner primers of the tetra markers are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The PCR reactions were set up as described for allele-specific primers. The amplification profile was 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products (3 µl) were size-fractionated on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with 5 µg/mL-1 ethidium bromide and the bands were visualized under ultraviolet light. Tetra markers were tested on five SNPs of rice landraces and on eight SNPs of mungbean mapping parents.\n              CEL-I SNP genotyping method\n                500 g celery was purchased at a local farmer’s market. Leaves were removed and the stems were blended in a juicer. CEL-I was enriched through (NH4)2SO4 precipitation as described by [15]. Desalted CEL-I extract was stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Test digestions using 0.5 to 2.5 µl CEL-I extract showed that 1 µl were optimal for genotyping. The CEL-I working solution for each reaction contained 1 µL CEL-I enzyme, 1.5 µL CEL-I buffer and 7.5 µL distilled deionized water. 10× CEL-I buffer contained 1 M MgSO4, 1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 2 M KCl, 10% Triton X-100, and 20 mg/ml BSA. PCR fragments produced with the outer primers of the tetra markers described above were used for CEL-I genotyping. PCR products derived from different plant lines were mixed in a ratio of a 1:1 ratio (v/v). For genotyping progenies of mapping parents, two assays per sample were prepared. In one assay the DNA of the progeny was mixed with DNA of mapping parent one, and in the second assay it was mixed with DNA of mapping parent two. For genotyping mapping parents, also two assays per locus were performed. In one assay the DNA of one mapping parent was mixed with the DNA of the other parent, and in the second assay the DNA of each mapping parent was genotyped separately. When the SNP base was identical with the base present in the DNA mixed with the sample, no cut by CEL-I was obtained, while in the presence of one or more polymorphic bases, CEL-I could introduce a cut into the fragment. This way, the reference, variant or heterozygote genotype at SNP base located in the tested PCR fragments could be determined. For the assay, the DNA double strands were denaturated by incubation at 99 °C for 10 min, reannealing the stands by cooling down to 70 °C, and subsequently reducing the incubation temperature from 70 °C to 49 °C in 70 cycles with -0.3 °C intervals per 20 s. 10 µl ice-cold CEL-I working solution was added to the sample on ice, mixed and incubated at different temperatures. For PCR fragments of less than 300 bp, the usually suggested CEL-I treatment incubation temperature of 45 °C was too high and yielded strong background and weak bands, while a temperature of 36 °C seemed to be suitable to yield bands after specifically cutting mismatch bases (Fig. 1). For the CEL-I genotyping in the current study, the samples were incubated at 34 °C for 10 min and then cooled down to -20 °C. Electrophoresis and DNA fragment visualization was performed as described for tetra markers. A simplified version of CEL-I digestion was performed by performing PCR on DNA mixtures, rather than mixing fragments post-PCR.\n                      \n                    Fig. 1\n                        Optimization of the incubation temperature for CEL-I treatment. The SNP tested was tetra_12. Incubation at 36 ° was found to be optimal to specifically cut at the mismatch site in position 171 bp of the 269 bp fragment, producing bands with 170 and 99 bp. The additional smaller band below around 90 bp is probably due to the sequence context around the SNP (please refer to the discussion)\n                      \n              ResultsSNP validation in rice by sequencing and testing allele-specific PCR, tetra markers and CEL-I genotyping\n                In total, five SNPs detected through the 384-SNP GoldenGate (Indica x Indica) array were selected for verification. Before testing PCR-based genotyping on these SNPs, the SNP data obtained from the GoldenGate array were verified by sequencing on 11 rice landraces (Table 4).Table 4\n                        SNPs among rice landraces selected from Golden Gate genotyping data\n                      Golden Gate dataSequencing dataLocus namePrimer nameRefVarR1R4R5R7R10R15R17R18R20R21R254:22435296tetra_1GAGGGGGAGGGGG5:44806tetra_2CGGCCSCCCCCCC6:14504992tetra_3GAGGGGGGGGGRA7:3650191tetra_4ACCAAAAAAAAAA9:6982338tetra_5CTCCCCCCCCCCC\n                      Ref.: reference sequence, Var.: variant. R1 – R25: rice landrace accession number\n                    \n                Allele-specific PCR, in addition to the allele-specific bands, yielded several secondary bands for tetra_1, but still genotypes were predicted correctly except for one case (R14). The allele-specific markers for tetra _3 predicted heterozygote genotypes for 21 out of 26 genotypes (Fig. 2) and revealed the correct genotype only in one sample (R25). The other allele-specific primers did not produce bands that distinguished the SNP alleles (data not shown). This result showed that allele-specific primers as designed for this experiment are not useful for genotyping SNPs in rice samples. Allele-specific primers were not tested on mungbean.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        Genotyping of rice using allele-specific markers. a) Tetra_1, b) Tetra_3. The SNP bases are indicated at the bottom of the gel images. The top row shows the allele-specific PCR results, and the SNP array genotyping or sequencing results are shown in the bottom row\n                      \n                Testing tetra markers on these SNPs showed that markers tetra_1, 2 and 3 had the tendency to show heterozygote genotypes, although the accessions were homozygote at the tested loci. The A variant for the G/A SNP in tetra_1 was correctly recognized by tetra markers, while most G variants were erroneously genotyped as G/A heterozygotes (Fig. 3). The G/A SNP of tetra_1 was located between G residues, which might have affected the specific initiation of amplification by primer for the G-allele. The SNP in tetra_2 was located in a repeat sequence (AGCTTG), and the C-specific primer initiated polymerase chain reaction at the target site and at the second AGCTTG motif located 13 bp upstream the target sequence in all samples with the C allele present. In addition, the inner primer for the G allele was not specific and amplified a fragment in all samples suggesting erroneous heterozygote genotypes. Tetra marker tetra_3 gave in many cases erroneous heterozygote genotypes, as the inner reverse primer specific for the A allele yielded products, albeit at low amounts, when only the G allele was present. Only tetra markers tetra_4 gave the correct genotypes and detected the C-variant in R1. Tetra_5 scored seven homozygous samples. In contrast, CEL-I genotyping reliably detected all heterozygote and homozygote SNPs correctly (Fig. 4). The G/A SNP between R4 and R15, as well as the heterozygote G/C in R7 and the G/C SNP between R18 and R1 were correctly detected. The same with tetra_3, the heterozygote base in R21 and the SNP among lines R10 and R25 were detected. Also the SNPs in tetra 4 between R1 and R25 and R1 and R20 were correctly detected. Tetra-5 did not contain any SNP, therefore no CEL-I cut was observed in this fragment.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        Genotyping selected rice accessions by tetra markers: a) tetra_1, b) tetra_2 and c) tetra_3, d) tetra_4, e) terta_5.

Sequencing confirmed the SNPs for tetra_6, 7, 9, 12 and 13, but not for tetra_8, 10 and 11 (Table 5). In addition to the SNPs previously found by genotyping by sequencing, Sanger sequencing of the PCR fragments produced with the outer tetra primers resulted in additional SNPs for tetra 6, 7, 9, 10 and 13. The outer primers for tetra_11 did not yield any product from TC1966 and therefore could not be sequenced. Tetra-11 was monomorphic between NM94 and V2802 and tetra_8 was monomorphic between all mapping parents. The amplicon of tetra_10 contained several heterozygous sites in all mapping parents, but sequencing did not corroborate the presence of the G/A polymorphism predicted by GBS. This sequencing exercise showed that 3 out of the 8 selected SNPs predicted by GBS were erroneous, probably due to wrong mapping of GBS tags to the reference sequence, and due to insufficient sequencing depth.Table 5\n                        Mungbean SNPs detected by genotyping by sequencing among the mapping parents NM92, NM94, TC1966 and V2802 and targeted for genotyping by tetra markers and CEL-I\n                      GBS dataSequencing dataLocus namePrimer nameSNP Position in PCR fragmentNM92TC1966NM94V2802NM92TC1966NM94V28021:26,370,595tetra_6144TATTTATT2:23,741,639tetra_7181TTTATTTA3:11,561,441tetra_8-CGCCC\n                              C\n                            cc3:10,830,938tetra_9200GGGAGGGA5:9,090,455tetra_10-GAGGG,\n                              G\n                            GG7:13,713,780tetra_11-AAAGAAA\n                              A\n                            10:3,159,416tetra_12171CGCGCGCG12:9,262,432tetra_13140TCCCTCCC\n                      The numbers refer to the position of the SNP in the PCR fragment obtained from the mapping parents using the outer tetra primers.

Tetra markers applied without an additional mismatch base genotyped four out of the five sequence-corroborated SNPs correctly. Only for tetra_13 did the tetra marker fail to reveal the correct genotype (Fig. 5). Genotyping of F7 populations TC1966 x NM92 and/or V2802 x NM94 with tetra_6, 7, 9 and 12 showed the segregation of the SNP genotype in the populations (Additional file 1) and suggested that the tetra markers were appropriate for genotyping populations.\n                      \n                    Fig. 5\n                        Test of tetra markers tetra-6, 7, 8, 9, 10 11, 12 and 13 on 4 mungbean mapping parents TV1966, NM92, V2802 and NM94. The bands indicating the SNP base are labeled with arrows\n                      \n                The outer primers of the tetra markers were used to amplify fragments from genomic DNA of the mapping parents containing the putative SNP sites. PCR amplification products from TC1966 were pooled with those from NM92, and products from NM94 were pooled with those from V2802. The pure samples and the mixtures were submitted to CEL-I treatment. In un-pooled PCR fragments obtained from the four mapping parents, CEL-I cutting was observed at the heterozygous bases in fragments of tetra_6, 7 and 8 in NM92 and tetra_10 in all mapping parents (Fig. 6, Table 6). High background was obtained with tetra_9 from all mapping parents. This fragment contained microsatellite-like motifs, which could have led to destabilization of the DNA double strand of the short fragments and could have transiently created cutting sites for CEL-I. Further reduction of the reaction temperature to avoid this effect was not tried. CEL-I treatment of mixtures of SNP-containing PCR fragments of the mapping parents resulted in the expected DNA fragments for all loci (Fig. 6, Tables 5 and 6). In addition to the cuts at heterozygote sites, in mixtures of tetra_6 PCR fragments from NM92 and TC1966, an additional cut was produced at position 144 (Fig. 6a). In tetra_7, as expected from the sequencing data, the heterozygous site at position 181 of the PCR fragment from NM92 caused a CEL-I cut, resulting in a 181 and a 79 bp band, while in mixtures of NM94/V2802 PCR fragments CEL-I genotyping correctly showed the T/A polymorphism in position 181 of the fragment (Fig. 6b, Tables 5 and 6). The monomorphic locus tetra_8 remained un-cut by CEL-I, cuts were introduced at the heterozygous sites in NM92 (Fig. 6c, Table 6). Tetra_10 gave a complex pattern due to the presence of multiple SNPs in the PCR fragment (Table 6), while CEL-I restriction of tetra_11 fragments gave no cuts, as expected for these monomorphic fragments. Mixtures of fragments of tetra_12 from TC1966 and NM92, as well as from V2802 and NM94 gave the expected cuts at the SNP position 171 of the PCR fragment. Similarly mixtures of PCR fragments of tetra_13 from TC1966 and NM92 gave the expected pattern of cut bands at the SNP site.\n                      \n                    Fig. 6\n                        CEL-I test genotyping on pure and mixed DNA of 4 mungbean mapping parents for tetra_6 (a), tetra_7 (b), tetra_8 (c), tetra_9 (d), tetra_10 (e), tetra_11 (f), tetra_12 (g), and tetra_13 (h). CEL-I cuts at mismatch sites. Mismatches can appear at heterozygote sites in one genotype (as in NM92 with tetra_6 (a) in positions 60/65 and 94, or at SNP sites when PCR fragments from homozygote mapping parents are mixed, as in tetra_6 at position 144 of TC1966/NM92, or in tetra_12 (g).

Instead of mixing the PCR fragments of the families with the fragments of the mapping parents, the PCR mastermix was spiked with either parent 1 or parent 2 DNA before amplification. For each sample, two amplification reactions were performed, one with parent 1 and another with parent 2-spiked DNA in order to detect heterozygous SNPs. Scoring of CEL-I genotyping was simple on amplicons with a single SNP like in tetra_12, but was also feasible when additional SNPs or heterozygous sites were present, like in tetra_9. By comparing the genotypes of the parent 1- and parent 2-spiked families, homozygote and heterozygote genotypes could be distinguished easily (Additional file 2). For example, for tetra_9 samples 14 and 128 showed the cut bands in both, NM94 and V2802-spiked CEL_I reactions, indicating that the samples are heterozygote for the tetra_9 SNP (Additional file 2).\n              Validation of SNP markers - Cost and working time considerations\n                Using commercial SNP assays for marker validation is relatively expensive. For mapping experiments dealing with complex traits involving many loci and numerous markers associated with them, the validation costs for candidate markers may surpass the genotyping costs. Table 7 shows a comparison of reagent costs and working time for different marker systems including CAPS (dCAPS), tetra markers, and CEL-I assays. Allele-specific markers were excluded from the calculation, as they did not perform sufficiently well in our experiments to be considered as a validation tool. DNA extraction costs were not considered, as these costs were equal for all listed assays. Many different restriction enzymes are required to cover SNPs in different sequence contexts, therefore developing new CAPS or dCAPS markers often requires purchasing new restriction enzymes. For the calculation in Table 7 we assumed that for every third SNP a new kind of restriction enzyme has to be purchased. The cost of supplies to develop a marker assay are clearly highest for CAPS markers, followed by tetra markers and CEL-I genotyping. The time for designing and testing the markers is assumed to be higher for tetra and CAPS markers than for CEL-I genotyping. Mainly due to the restriction enzyme costs, CAPS development remains the most expensive system. For routine genotyping, CEL-I would be the most expensive and laborious option, as two assays must be performed for each locus to distinguish homozygote from heterozygote variants. Therefore, for marker validation on a small number of samples, where mostly marker development costs play a role, CEL-I genotyping seems to be cheapest; for genotyping a larger sample, tetra markers are more cost-effective.Table 7\n                        Estimation of development and running costs for (d)CAPS, tetra marker and CEL-I-based genotyping (in US$)\n                      Development costs CAPS (dCAPS)Tetra markerCEL-IPrimer7.5157.5Restriction enzyme30 1PCR reagents0.480.480.96Gel electrophoresis and DNA band detection0.060.060.12TOTAL38.0415.549.58Work load Approximate working time for development 1 assay (h)0.250.250.1 Working time for testing0.120.080.12TOTAL0.370.330.22Routine analysis Hands-on time per assay (assuming 96 assays per run, in h)0.030.0250.06 Reagent costs per assay0.130.1050.19\n              DiscussionValidation of molecular markers for breeding may require testing many candidate markers. Only a few of them will be adopted for marker-assisted selection, while most markers may be discarded. Consequently, marker validation may constitute a major cost factor. In order to keep validation costs low and to avoid the need for expensive instruments, SNPs are often converted to PCR-based markers. We have tested allele-specific PCR, tetra markers and a CEL-I based genotyping method for validating selected SNP markers derived from an array-based SNP genotyping study on rice and from a GBS experiment in mungbean. In parallel, the targeted SNPs were validated by sequencing. As expected, not all SNPs pinpointed by the GBS experiment were true SNPs. Two of the putative SNPs of mungbean were in fact monomorphic. In mungbean, chromosomal rearrangements or an indel in the GBS tag in comparison to the reference sequence [20] led to erroneous mapping and resulted in false positive SNPs. In general array-based genotyping is considered more accurate than GBS, nevertheless GBS is widely used for genotyping rice [21], mungbean [17] and other crops. Shallow sequencing and erroneous mapping of sequence tags in GBS can yield wrong genotypes, but GBS is more cost effective than array-based genotyping and has the additional advantage that no previous information on the SNPs present in the samples is required [22].Allele-specific PCR was unsuitable to genotype SNPs in the rice samples without assay optimization and therefore was abandoned. The accuracy of tetra marker genotyping was affected by the sequence context. Introduction of a sequence mismatch near the 3' end of the primers to increase stability might have overcome this problem [8] but was not tested, as the study addressed only the least work- intensive SNP genotyping. Optimization of the SNP assays beyond gradient PCR to determine the optimal annealing temperature for the allele-specific and tetra primers was avoided, as the study aimed to assess the performance of the assays without laborious modifications.Previously published CEL-I protocols proved to be useful for SNP validation and genotyping [11, 12], but could be simplified to make the assays cheaper and easier to use. Stopping the CEL-I reaction by adding EDTA, as described by published protocols, was found to be unnecessary; similarly, the previously suggested desalting of the reaction mixtures prior to loading the DNA on the gel was eliminated, without affecting the scoring of the bands. Lowering the reaction temperature of CEL-I below 36 °C was essential to reduce the background. CEL-I genotyping for validation of SNP markers was the least costly method to develop, but the method required more resources per locus than tetra markers for genotyping large numbers of samples. Either PCR fragments containing the SNP have to be mixed after PCR, or DNA to be genotyped must be spiked with reference DNA. For each sample and locus, two CEL-I reactions have to be performed to distinguish homozygote from heterozygote genotypes, making the genotyping more expensive and more laborious. From our perspective, mixing DNA before PCR is the preferred CEL-I genotyping method, as spiking of the PCR master mix is less laborious and safer than handling the PCR fragments for combination after amplification. CEL-I genotyping also was more reliable than tetra markers, which may be affected by the sequence context of the SNP and require additional optimization of the assay, leading to longer development times and higher costs. However, CEL-I based genotyping was tedious on heterozygote samples, as the banding pattern became quite complex and difficult to score with increasing heterozygosity of the mapping parents.It can be expected that more modern genotyping tools such as KASP markers [23] are more accurate than the methods presented here, but require equipment such as a plate reader that might not be available to all users of molecular markers. By adopting an improved protocol for CEL-I genotyping we wanted to provide a simple and cheap method for genotyping for laboratories that lack specialized equipment.ConclusionsAllele-specific PCR was not suitable to genotype SNPs in rice. The genotyping accuracy of tetra markers was affected by low allele specifity of the inner primers, repeat sequences and nucleotide runs. In contrast, genotyping by using CEL-I digestion at low incubation temperatures performed well and was independent of the sequence context around the SNP. It was also more cost effective than tetra markers, as long as the number of tested samples remained small. Additional SNPs to the SNP selected for genotyping present in the PCR fragment can make scoring of CEL-I genotypes tedious. Therefore, PCR fragments for CEL-I genotyping should be kept small to minimize the presence of additional SNPs.Abbreviations\n                ARMS PCR: \n                    Amplification-refractory mutation system PCR\n                  BSA: \n                    Bovine serum albumin\n                  CAPS: \n                    Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence\n                  CTAB: \n                    Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide\n                  dCAPS: \n                    Derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences\n                  EDTA: \n                    Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\n                  GBS: \n                    Genotyping by sequencing\n                  HEPES: \n                    4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid\n                  KASP: \n                    Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR\n                  PCR: \n                    Polymerase chain reaction\n                  QTL: \n                    Quantitative trait locus\n                  SNP: \n                    Single nucleotide polymorphism\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsWe thank the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany, for co-funding the study.

Evidence from genetic studies has revealed the role of genome structural variations, specifically copy number variants (CNVs), in the etiology of SCZ. Nevertheless, the occurrence of CNVs and their relation to SCZ has remained relatively unstudied in the diverse Han Chinese population.\n              \n                Results\n                We used a case/control paradigm, including 476 cases and 1023 controls. All samples were genotyped using the Axiom® Exome Genotyping Arrays. Four CNVs, including two deletions and two duplications, were detected in this study. Notably, the 16p11.2 duplication from 29.3 Mb to 29.6 Mb was detected in four cases (0.84%) and one control (0.098%) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0377).\n              \n                Conclusions\n                The results highlight the potential role of these deletions and duplications in the development of SCZ. Clearly, larger sample sized studies are needed for a careful localization of these CNVs and to possibly detect more deletions and/or duplications, associated with the development of SCZ in the Han Chinese population.\n              KeywordsSchizophreniaCopy number variantsHan ChineseBackgroundThe role of genome structural variations, specifically copy number variants (CNVs), in the development of mental disorders is a growing area of study. Due to the potential polygenic effects and the capacity to alter gene dosage, CNVs may have dramatic consequences on expression levels and therefore phenotype. Szatkiewicz et al hypothesize that CNV deletions are more severe compared to CNV duplications, due to the loss of function effect [1]. Furthermore, large CNVs are more severe than small CNVs, which affect fewer genes and regulatory regions. Because of their direct impact on gene modification, CNVs play a major role in evolution and have the potential to disturb some genomically unstable areas. For instance, the 1q21.1 region is associated with neurological development and thus could have impacted brain evolution. Therefore, deletion of 1q21.1 could explain the neurological and psychiatric conditions observed in patients carrying this CNV. The larger expression of the genome by brain tissue compared to other tissues explains the rationale for selecting CNVs as likely candidates for modulating psychiatric illnesses. As a result of the cost associated with whole genome sequencing, exome arrays have emerged as a viable option for the detection of both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CNVs. Only protein-coding DNA will be examined, thereby providing an approximate portrayal of the genomic expression. Exome arrays have both confirmed SNPs previously established by genome wide association studies (GWAS), as well as identified novel SNPs associated with a wide-range of diseases. Exome sequencing has been utilized for CNV analysis in the genome analysis of Swedish patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and has confirmed some of the previously determined CNVs from GWAS [1]. Nevertheless, the diverse Han Chinese population represents a major group that has remained relatively unstudied with regards to the occurrence of CNVs and their relation to mental health disorders, such as SCZ. Several previous studies implicated numerous rare CNVs in SCZ, including the 1q21.1 deletion [2], 15q11.2 deletion [3], Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) region duplication [4] and 16p11.2 duplication [1]. These new findings raise fundamental clinical and scientific questions concerning classification of major neuropsychiatric disorders, modes of inheritance, diagnostics, and genetic counseling. None of these CNVs have been investigated in Chinese Han population. In this paper we analyze the exome SNP array data in 476 SCZ cases and 1023 healthy controls taken from southern China for the presence of CNVs, particularly focusing on the four CNVs listed above.Results and DiscussionThe 16p11.2 duplication from 29.3 Mb to 29.6 Mb was detected in four cases (0.84%) and one control (0.098%) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0377, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 1). A previous investigation by McCarthy et al [5] reported an association of an adjacent duplication from 29.6 Mb to 30.2 Mb within 16p11.2 with SCZ (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-5 for the initial cohort, p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.022 in the replication cohort). A subsequent meta-analysis from a follow-up study [5] involving 8,590 individuals with schizophrenia, 2,172 with developmental delay or autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 4,822 with bipolar disorder, and 30,492 controls reported a p value of 4.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-7 for association with SCZ. The authors also reported an association between the 16p11.2 duplication and both bipolar disorder and autism. Alternatively, the 16p11.2 deletion has been associated with autism and developmental disorders, suggesting an overlapping etiology between SCZ, ASD and other developmental disorders. The 16p11.2 duplication is also associated with a decrease in brain size compared to 16p11.2 deletion, and it is worth noting the possible connection between autism and increased brain volumes, not only in the content of McCarthy et al, but also in other studies.Table 1\n                      The significant level of the identified rare CNVs\n                    LocusPosition in Mb (hg19)Cases (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>476)Control (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>1023)ORFisher's PCases from previous studiesa (%)Controls from previous studiesa (%)Frequency in Chinese populationb (%)1q21.1 delchr1:146.5–147.810NA0.31750.1700.0160.09215q11.2 delchr15:22.7–23.1112.150.53440.6400.4100.254WBS dupchr7:72.7–74.320NA0.10070.0440.0160.01616p11.2 dupchr16:29.3–29.6418.660.03770.0590.0000.087\n                    \n                                 aResults from previous reported European data sets (Br J Psychiatry. 2014;204(2):108–114). bFrequencies of the CNVs in Chinese population, which were established from the Chinese study (Biol Psychiatry. 2016;80(4):331–337)\n                  One out of 476 cases (0.21%) carried the 1q21.1 deletion, which was not expressed in any of the controls (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.3175, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 1). The 1q21.1 deletion spans 1.3 Mb (chromosome 1: 146.5 Mb- 147.8 Mb) in the distal region of 1q21.1, not containing the TAR region. This deletion is also well known to be associated with SCZ, although the deletion region in our results indicated a much smaller area of deletion than Stephansson et al. described [6–8] The associated region is gene rich, and contains the gene BCL9, and when mutated, BCL9 has been shown by Li et al. to be associated with schizophrenia, as well as bipolar and major depression in the Chinese Han population [2]. However, the gene function for BCL9 is largely unknown. Besides schizophrenia, the highly unstable 1q21.1 region has also been implicated in a host of other human disorders, among which are idiopathic mental retardation [9, 10], autism/ASD [9], congenital heart disease [11], microcephaly/macrocephaly [9, 12] and neuroblastoma [13]. Dumas and Sikela indicated that the 1q21.1 CNV region contains the vast majority of DUF1220 protein domains, which portray a striking human lineage with a specific increase in copy number relative to the other great apes [14]. The increase in DUF1220 roughly correlates to increased brain size, and thus it is relevant to point out that deletions in 1q21.1 may also be associated with microcephaly, possibly due to a decrease in DUF1220. This trait is a common phenotype for schizophrenia as opposed to autism [15].The 15q11.2 deletion from 22.7 Mb to 23.1 Mb occurred in one case (0.21%) and one control (0.098%) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.5344, Fisher’s exact test) (Table 1). The 15q11.2 deletion is one of the regions deleted in the Prader-Willi syndrome, whose symptoms include obsessive compulsive behavior, adaptive skills difficulty, and low intellectual ability. Of note, the Prader-Willi deletion in the Prader-Willi syndrome is much larger than that we identified. In addition, the 15q11.2 deletion has been reported in three different studies to be associated with SCZ [4]. The most relevant gene affected in the 15q11.2 region, CYFIP1 interacts with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) as well as the Rho GTPase Rac1, which is involved in the maintenance of neuronal structures [16].We also observed that the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) region from 22.7 Mb to 23.1 Mb on chromosome 7 was duplicated in two cases (0.42%), but not in controls (Table 1), for a p-value of 0.1007. The association between the 7q11.23 duplication and schizophrenia was previously reported by Mulle et al., [17] as well as Kirov et al [4]. Despite the fact that the specific biological pathways are unknown, the SCZ patients with WBS duplication also all had social anxiety and language delay prior to the onset of SCZ.Take all the four highlighted CNVs as a whole, 1.68% of our cases have a pathogenic CNV, it is about eight times higher than that in the control group (0.20%). The detailed locations are given in Fig. 1 and the Additional file 1: Table S2.\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Schematic illustration of the chromosomal locations of the rare CNVs using UCSC Genome Browser. a 1q21.1 del; b 15q11.2 del; c 16p11.2 dup; d WBS dup.

The results highlight the potential role of these deletions and duplications in the development of SCZ. Clearly, larger sample sized studies are needed for a careful localization of these CNVs and to possibly detect more deletions and/or duplications, associated with the development of SCZ in the Han Chinese population.MethodsWe used a case/control paradigm, including 476 cases and 1023 controls (Additional file 1: Table S1). Before study enrollment, all SCZ patients and healthy subjects were required to sign a consent form. Diagnosis of SCZ was confirmed by interviews with at least two experienced psychiatrists in accordance with criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition (DSM-IV). Exclusion criteria included the presence of other mood or neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, or mental retardation. Control subjects were recruited by advertisement and selected based on the results from a questionnaire, concerning history of obstetric complications, substantial head injury, seizures, neurological or psychiatric disease, hypertension, diabetes, and substance abuse, as well as family medical histories. Subjects with any personal or family history of psychiatric illness among their first-degree relatives were excluded. The patients were recruited from several hospitals in Jiangsu province. All patients and healthy controls were age-matched and recruited from the cities of Wuxi and Nanjing in the Jiangsu province. Individuals not born in Jiangsu or whose family members were not born in Jiangsu were excluded from the study based on self-reported data. In addition, there was no blood relation between patients. All participants are Han Chinese. All samples were genotyped using the Axiom® Exome Genotyping Arrays. We first calculated the quality control measures (Dish-QC, DQC), and arrays with DQC<U+2009><<U+2009>0.82 (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>26) signified poor quality, and could result in false-positive CNVs, so they were excluded from the study. We then called CNV for the left samples using PennCNV [18]. The genotyping calls and signal intensity data were generated using Affymetrix Power Tools, and then converts into Log R Ratio (LRR) and B Allele Frequency (BAF) values. To minimize the noise of genome-wide intensity signals, only samples within the s.d. of the normalized intensity (LRR<U+2009><<U+2009>0.35) were included. Wave artifacts roughly correlating with GC content resulting from hybridization bias of low full-length DNA quantity are known to interfere with the accurate inference of CNVs. Only samples where |GC base pair wave factor (GCWF)|<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05 were accepted. PLINK's identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis was used to detect cryptic relatedness based on the common variants (minor allele frequency<U+2009>><U+2009>1%) [19]. When a pair of individuals exhibited a PI_HAT<U+2009>><U+2009>0.2, the member of the pair with the lower call rate was excluded from the analysis (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>3). The clean_cnv.pl program was adopted to merge adjacent calls of the same individual using the fraction threshold (0.5, calculated as base pair length). CNVs were then excluded if they were covered by<U+2009><<U+2009>5 probes or had a probe density<U+2009>><U+2009>1 probe/40 kb. If the count of CNV calls made by PennCNV exceeds 70, the DNA quality was assumed to be poor. Therefore, only samples with CNV call count <70 were included. After quality control, 476 cases and 1023 controls were kept for further analysis.More than ten CNVs have been convincingly associated with SCZ [20, 21], and most of the previous studies are mainly carried out in Caucasian populations. We try to replicate the reported CNVs identified in Caucasian populations using a Han Chinese sample.Four CNVs were found to be overrepresented in our cases and further evaluated as a result of our study, the 1q21.1 deletion, the 15q11.2 deletion, the WBS duplication and the 16p11.2 duplication. We compared the frequencies in the cases and controls groups for each particular region, and a Fisher's exact test was used to test the significance of the difference. All of these have been previously found to be associated with schizophrenia by multiple studies.Abbreviations\n                ASD: \n                    Autism spectrum disorder\n                  CNV: \n                    Copy number variant\n                  GWAS: \n                    Genome wide association study\n                  SCZ: \n                    Schizophrenia\n                  SNP: \n                    Single nucleotide polymorphism\n                  WBS: \n                    Williams-Beuren syndrome\n                  DeclarationsAcknowledgementsNot applicable.\n                Funding\n                This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.81301147), the Medical Research Pharmaceutical Program of Wuxi Hospital Management Center (YGZXY1306), and the Science & Technology Development Foundation of Wuxi Municipal Science & Technology Bureau (CSZON1316).\n              \n                Availability of data and materials\n                All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article [and its Additional file 1].\n              \n                Authors’ contributions\n                JY and CJ conceived and designed this study.

During ripening, carotenoid accumulation determines the fruit colors while chlorophyll degradation. These traits have been, and continue to be, a significant focus for plant breeding efforts. Previous work has found strong evidence for a relationship between CYC-B gene expression and the orange color of fleshy fruit. Other work has identified a point mutation in SGR that impedes chlorophyll degradation and causes brown flesh color to be retained in some tomato varieties.\n              \n                Methods\n                We crossed two inbred lines, KNY2 (orange) and KNB1 (brown) and evaluated the relationship between these genes for their effect on fruit color. Phenotypes of F2 generation plants were analyzed and a novel ‘orange-brown’ fruit color was identified.\n              \n                Results\n                We confirm two SNPs, one in CYC-B and another in SGR gene sequence, associated with segregation of ‘orange-brown’ fruit color in F2 generation. The carotenoid and chlorophyll content of a fleshy fruit was assessed across the different phenotypes and showed a strong correlation with expression pattern of carotenoid biosynthesis genes and SGR function. The orange-brown fruit has high ß-carotene and chlorophyll. Our results provide valuable information for breeders to develop tomato fruit of a novel color using molecular markers.\n              KeywordsOrange-brown tomato\n                CYC-B\n              ß-carotene\n                SGR\n              ChlorophyllBackgroundTomatoes are predominantly grown as an agricultural crop and are considered a healthy food due to their high nutritional value [1]. Tomatoes are cholesterol free, rich in fiber and protein, and low in fat and calories. Approximately 80% of the tomatoes produced are used in tomato-based foods that include tomato juice, puree, paste, sauce and salsa [2]. Daily consumption of tomato sauce has been shown to reduce DNA damage in white blood cells and cancerous prostate tissues [3]. In addition, consumption of lycopene-containing foods can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer [4]. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop high-lycopene tomatoes using conventional breeding techniques and genetic manipulation. In addition to lycopene content, new color developments also attract consumers in the fresh market. Tomato fruit color is an important indicator of eating quality for consumers and thus considerable research has been directed towards its characterization and measurement [5]. During the ripening stage, tomato color brightens due to carotenoid, lycopene accumulation, independently or in concert with chlorophyll degradation [6]. Subsequent lycopene accumulation during the final stages of fruit ripening affects color development and the health benefits, both important traits for consumers. In green vegetables and leaves, lycopene is concealed by green chlorophyllic pigments. However, in most fruits, lycopene and other carotenoids are responsible for the bright color development during the ripening stage [7]. Lycopene accounts for more than 80% of the accumulated carotenes in ripe tomato fruits. While ß-carotene accumulates to a lesser degree, it also constitutes a sizable portion of total carotene accumulation. Both lycopene and ß-carotene are essential to fulfill the nutritional requirements of a healthy animal and human diet [8].Carotenoid biosynthesis in plants occurs preferentially via the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway rather than the previously assumed mevalonic acid pathway [9, 10]. Although both pathways produce isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), the DOXP pathway [11] also leads to the formation of the plastidic carotenoids phytol, plastoquinone-9, and diterpenes (Fig. 1). IPP is a precursor of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is a carotenoid precursor. Using phytoene synthase (PSY) as a catalyst with GGPP leads to production of phytoene [12, 13]. The phytoene desaturase gene (PDS) converts phytoene to <U+03B6>-carotene. Three isoforms of the PSY gene have been identified in tomato. The PSY1 isoform is responsible for fruit ripening, whereas PSY2 and PSY3 are likely predominant in green tissues and roots, respectively [14–16]. PSY1 and PDS genes are upregulated during fruit ripening, while genes for enzymes carrying out cyclisation of lycopene such as ß-Lcy and e-Lcy are downregulated, resulting in low levels of ß-carotene during tomato ripening [17]. Our previous report had showed the evidence of CYC-B (ß-lycopene cyclase) gene expression associated with orange color of fleshy fruit in tomato [16].\n                    \n                  Fig. 1\n                      Metabolic pathways involved in biosynthesis of carotenoids via DOXP route with related genes of tomato. The enzymes involved in the carotenoid synthesis are: DOXP reductoisomerase (DXR), hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase (HDS), hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase (HDR), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), z-carotene desaturase (ZDS), carotene isomerase (CRTISO), lycopene e cyclase (LCYE), lycopene ß cyclase (LCYB), ß-carotene hydroxylase (CHYB), cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase 97C (CYP97C), zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), geranylgeranyl oxidase (GGRS), chlorophyll synthase (CHL). The carotenoids measured by HPLC are denoted in red color. Dotted rectangle denote carotenoid pathway, genes analyzed in this work are colored in green and regulatory gene SGR is colored in blue\n                                 \n                    Another important gene, SGR (STAY-GREEN) associated with color has been identified previously in some plant species [18–20]. SGR mutants showed brown color due to carotenoid accumulation and fail to degrade chlorophyll completely at ripening stage [21, 22]. For instance, SGR mutants that have been identified in other plant species (Arabidopsis, pepper, pea, and meadow fescue) displayed green phenotypes due to inhibition of chlorophyll degradation [19, 23–27]. Barry and Pandey [30] had reported that point mutation in SGR gene causes loss of protein function and leads to inhibit chlorophyll degradation which exhibited green fleshy fruit color in ‘Black cherry’ variety. Flavonoids also play an important role in determining tomato fruit color. Flavonoids primarily accumulate in the tomato fruit peel, and are absent in the flesh, due to a lack of expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes in flesh tissues [28, 29].Because of their importance, our study focused on developing a new tomato fruit color that is enriched for ß-carotene and chlorophyll content. Thus, our work evaluated the segregation of fruit color and, ß-carotene and chlorophyll level, in the F1 and F2 populations, developed by crossing orange and brown fruit.MethodsPlant material\n                Tomato seeds of inbred lines KNY2 (orange) and KNB1 (brown) were obtained from Kana Seed Co. Ltd (Korea). Seeds were sown on moist filter paper in petri dishes and germinated at 30 °C in the dark. The germinated seeds were transferred to plastic trays containing soil mix and maintained at growth room conditions. When plants (F1 and F2) had four true leaves, they were transplanted into plastic pots and grown in greenhouse (25 °C day/18 °C night, 70% air humidity and natural light) at Sunchon National University, Korea. Furthermore, three fruits were harvested from individual plant at ripe (57 days after pollination (DAP)) stage for HPLC analysis. Fruit color was confirmed from 6 F1 plants, 192 F2 plants (obtained from 6 F1 plants) and described in results section.\n              RNA extraction and PCR amplification\n                Total RNA was extracted from fleshy fruit tissue at early (E, 17 DAP), mature (M, 39 DAP), turning (T, 45 DAP), and ripe (R, 57 DAP) stages using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. High-quality RNA was eluted in RNase-free water and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) before cDNA synthesis. Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted using cDNA synthesized from the RNA of each stage. PCR was performed with the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 40 s and final extension at 72 °C for 2 min.\n              SNP detection\n                Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected using 3’-blocked and unlabeled oligonucleotide probes (HybProbe). PCR was performed using LightCycler® 480 Resolight saturating dye (Roche, Germany) to generate melting curves characteristic of the genotype under the probe. Melting curves were generated and analyzed using the LightCycler®96 Instrument System (Roche, Germany). PCR reactions were performed with a 95 °C pre-denaturation for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 60 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension s at 72 °C for 40 s. Primer and probe sets used for SNP detection are described in Additional file 2 Table S1.\n              HPLC analysis\n                Standards for ß-carotene, lycopene, phytoene, and chlorophyll were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich (Sigma Co., USA). The carotenoids and chlorophyll were separated using reverse phase columns (Kinetex 206 µm, C18 100A, 100<U+2009>×<U+2009>4.60 mm, Phenomenex, USA). The whole fruit extracts were filtered with a 0.2 µm PTFE filter prior to injection. Mobile phase A was 78% methanol and B was 100% ethyl acetate. Release conditions were 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–15 min, 10% B; 15–20 min, 100% B; 20–30 min, 0% B at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The phytoene, carotenoids and chlorophyll were identified and quantified based on the retention time and the absorbance between 280 nm, 450 nm and 660 nm of standards. The values represent the mean of three biological replicates.\n              Statistical analysis\n                The EF1a gene was used as reference for normalization. The relative gene expression was calculated based on <U+0394><U+0394>Ct method (LightCycler®96, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Data are presented as the mean of three biological replicates. The data were analyzed using a Tukey Pairwise Comparisons test (P<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) in the Minitab 17 Statistical Software (State College, Pennsylvania, USA). Chi-square analysis to test goodness-of-fit was performed using Graphpad Prism 7.02 (Graphpad software, California, USA).\n              Results and discussionSegregation analysis\n                Inbred lines KNY2 and KNB1 were characterized for their fruit phenotype during ripening (Additional file 1: Fig. S1) and crossed. Fruit color phenotypes of F1 and F2 progeny were analyzed. All F1 progeny produced orange-colored fruit suggesting that orange color is dominantly inherited over other fruit colors in this experiment [16] (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). To examine the genotypic variation in the F2 generations, SNP sites of SGR and CYC-B genes were identified [16, 30]. The SGR gene plays an important role in the regulation of chlorophyll degradation in tomato fruits and leaves [31, 32]. The lack of SGR protein function in KNB1 is likely due to a C<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>T point mutation at position 371 bp from the start codon (ATG) in the SGR genomic sequence [30]. This modification results in brown-colored fruit, suggesting that chlorophyll is retained and conceals the pigmentation in the fruit (Fig. 2a, c). This observation confirms previous work by Barry and Pandey [30] identified this allele as responsible for the brown fruit color phenotype. Another gene that plays an important role in orange color formation and involved in improving carotenoid content in tomato fruit is CYC-B [33, 34]. This gene is suggested to play a major role in fruit pigmentation of the KNY2 inbred during the ripening stages. In a previous study, we detected and confirmed a SNP at the -77 position of the CYC -B gene that showed perfect association and a dominant phenotype in KNY2 for orange fruit color [16] (Fig. 2b, d). In the F1 generation, the 371 SNP site of SGR was detected as CT heterozygous which ‘T’ is a recessive allele (Fig. 2c). Similarly, the -77 SNP position of CYC-B was detected as GT heterozygous (Fig. 2d). These results suggest that a ‘T’ represents a dominant allele in CYC-B genes and leads to orange color formation in the F1 generation.\n                      \n                    Fig. 2\n                        \n                                       a.

The heterozygous F1 (GT) is represented with an orange curve\n                      \n                Fruit color phenotypes were scored in the F2 generation and the segregation ratios were analyzed with the corresponding genotypes. Four color phenotypes were observed in the F2 generation, namely red, orange, brown and orange-brown in the ripe stage (R, 57 DAP) (Fig. 3). Genotypes TT, CT and CC were identified at the 371 (SGR) SNP position whereas TT, GT and GG genotypes were identified at the -77 (CYC-B) SNP position (Table 1). In total, 192 F2 plants were evaluated (Table 1). Interestingly, a new ‘orange-brown’ color was identified in this F2 population and was found to segregate approximating a 9:3:3:1 (Orange: Red: Orange-brown: Brown) ratio (Table 2). The chi-square for F2 progeny segregation ratio showed an acceptable fit to 9:3:3:1 (Chi-square (<U+03C7>\n                           2)<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.370, P >0.90). The genotype at the SGR 371 SNP site was confirmed to show approximating a 1:2:1 ratio of TT: CT: CC in the F2 plants. The F2 plants with a TT genotype were either orange-brown or brown in color, whereas the F2 plants with a genotype of CT and CC were either red or orange (Table 1). The CYC-B -77 SNP site with a TT or GT genotype corresponded with an orange or orange-brown phenotype while GG genotypes were either red or brown (Table 1). Fruit color was dependent on the genotypes at both the SGR and CYC-B.\n                      \n                    Fig. 3\n                        The fruit colors observed in the F2 generation at ripe stage (R, 57 DAP)\n                      Table 1\n                        Phenotypic and genotypic segregation of F2 generation plants from KNB1 x KNY2\n                       No. PlantsGenotypePhenotypeNo. Plants\n                                            SGR 371 position\n                                            CYC-B -77 positionF1 generation6C-TG-TOrange6F2 generation192C-CT-TOrange11G-TOrange22G-GRed18C-TT-TOrange18G-TOrange56G-GRed21T-TT-TOrange-brown12G-TOrange-brown22G-GBrown12Table 2\n                        Segregation ratio of fruit color in F2 generation plants from KNB1 x KNY2\n                      CrossF2 Segregation\n                                            <U+03C7>2 (9:3:3:1)\n                                            P-valueOrangeRedOrange-brownBrownTotal  No. PlantsObserved1073934121920.3700.95-0.90Expected108363612192\n              Expression of CYC-B and SGR\n                        \n                The aim of this work was to identify the relationship between fruit color phenotype and variant genotypes in a segregating F2 population. Our previous work reported that the transcript level of CYC-B regulates orange color in tomato fruit [16]. Researchers focused on carotenoid content [17, 35] were also reported that regulation of CYC-B increases the accumulation of ß-carotene in the tomato fruit during ripening. Similar results were observed during fruit development in bell pepper, a related species [36–39]. Based on the previous findings, we compared transcript levels of CYC-B among the different phenotypes observed in this experiment. The mRNA levels of CYC-B were analyzed during ripening at early, mature, turning and ripe stages as described by [40]. Interestingly, the orange-brown phenotype showed increased expression of CYC-B during fruit development, similar to that observed in the orange phenotype (Fig. 4). The level of CYC-B expression was significantly (Tukey Pairwise Comparisons test, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) higher at the turning stage of ripening than in earlier stages in both phenotypes (Fig. 4). This corroborates our hypothesis that expression of CYC-B contributes to orange coloration as well as to the orange-brown color. As expected, the transcript level of CYC-B was not increased in red or brown phenotypes during ripening. The dramatic increase in expression of CYC-B during T and R stages of orange and orange-brown phenotypes suggests high ß-carotene levels in both phenotypes. In addition to CYC-B, the expression of biosynthetic genes such as PSY1, carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO) and SGR was examined (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). The mRNA levels of these three genes showed a pattern of increased expression during ripening across all four phenotypes. No significant difference (Tukey Pairwise Comparisons test, p<U+2009><<U+2009>0.05) in gene expression was observed among the phenotypes during ripening (Additional file 1: Fig. S3).\n                      \n                    Fig. 4\n                        Expression of the CYC-B gene during fruit development in F2 generation plants. RNA was extracted from fruit samples at early (E), mature (M), turning (T), and ripe (R) developmental stages. Relative amounts of mRNA were determined by RT-qPCR after normalizing with EF1a transcript. The relative expression levels of CYC-B were compared to early stage (E) level (set to 1) in each F2 plant. Data represent an average<U+2009>±<U+2009>s.e.m of three biological replicates and asterisk indicates values significantly different (p<U+2009><0.05). a: Red, b: Orange, c: Brown, d: Orange-brown\n                                    \n                      \n                Barry and Pandey [30] reported that a SNP (C<U+2009><U+2192><U+2009>T) at nucleotide 371 in the tomato SGR gene results in a mutation that truncates the protein at glutamine 91. Characterized in the variety ‘Black Cherry,’ the truncation introduces a premature stop codon and is predicated to carry null alleles that cause complete loss of protein function. Varieties with this SNP could thus inhibit chlorophyll degradation and retain green flesh. Consistent with these results, the new orange-brown phenotype reported herein retains brown coloration may be due to loss of SGR protein function while concurrent high expression levels of CYC-B result in orange fruit color. This combination could explain the orange-brown phenotype we observed.\n              HPLC analysis of carotenoid and chlorophyll content\n                We investigated the carotenoid and chlorophyll content of tomato fruit during various developmental stages of ripening. All phenotypes identified in the F2 population, red, orange, brown and orange-brown, were analyzed in M, T and R stages of ripening. Lycopene, ß-carotene and phytoene levels were shown to increase as the fruit progressed through ripening stages for all four phenotypes (Table 3). The orange-brown phenotype was observed to have low levels of lycopene and high levels of ß-carotene, similar to the orange phenotype in R stage (Table 3). This result was consistent with our transcript analysis showing that higher expression of CYC-B correlates with accumulation of ß-carotene and causes orange color pigmentation [17] (Fig. 4). The high chlorophyll content after ripening of the orange-brown phenotype was similar in level to the brown phenotype (Table 3). By contrast, chlorophyll content was decreased in red and orange phenotypes at ripening, while there was no significant difference between brown and orange-brown phenotypes (p<U+2009><0.05). Carotenoid and chlorophyll of brown tomato phenotypes (SGR) have positive effect on human health [41, 42]. Chlorophyll in tomato fruits combined with lycopene increased antioxidant activity [43] and protect cells against oxidants and electrophiles [44]. Chlorophyll in SGR mutant tomato fruits could reduce risk of colon cancer in humans [45] and their derivatives can be used as agents of photodynamic therapy in cancer [46]. SGR mutant varieties also have agronomical advantages, positive yield is recorded in maize SGR variety FS854 and SGR rice variety SNU-SG1 [47]. In addition, increased water, carbohydrates, and protein content in husks, cobs, and seeds are reported in SGR maize variety L087602. SGR mutant lines of wheat showed heat tolerance at terminal growth stage [48]. Therefore, it assumes, SGR mutant cultivars could be good source of better yield, fruit quality, and heat stress tolerance in tomato breeding. We found that retention of chlorophyll together with higher ß-carotene produced ‘orange-brown’ phenotype of tomato.Table 3\n                        Phytoene, lycopene, ß-carotene, and chlorophyll content in F2 generation plants.

This fruit has high ß-carotene content and retains chlorophyll through ripening. The expression of CYC-B mRNA coincided with the accumulation of ß-carotene. The point mutation in SGR gene causes loss of protein function and leads to inhibit chlorophyll degradation. Present work provides insight into development of genotypes with enhanced ß-carotene accumulation and chlorophyll retention in tomato fruits. Combination of these two SNPs would be suitable for breeding ‘orange-brown’ color tomato cultivars.DeclarationsAcknowledgementsThis research was supported by the Golden Seed Project (Center for Horticultural Seed Development), Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA), Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF), Rural Development Administration (RDA) and Korea Forest Service (KFS).\n                Availability of data and materials\n                Plant materials and cDNA samples are available from the authors.\n              \n                Authors’ contributions\n                ISN, KHK and MC conceived and designed the study.
